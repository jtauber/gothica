  <head>ULFILAS</head>
  <p>
    Ulfilas (Gothic Wulfila) was born about the year 311 A.D., but where his birthplace was in the wide tract of country then inhabited by the Goths is not known. Although Ulfilas was born and grew up among the Goths, he was of Cappadocian descent. According to the testimony of the historian Philostorgius, the parents, or perhaps rather the grandparents, of Ulfilas were natives of Sadagolthina, near the town of Parnassus in Cappadocia, who had been carried off as captives by the Goths, during an irruption made by this people into the northern parts of Asia Minor in the year 267.

    In the year 332 he accompanied an embassy to Constantinople, where he remained until 341. In the latter year he was consecrated bishop of the Goths dwelling North of the Danube. For seven years (341–8) he laboured zealously among the Goths in Dacia, and won over a great multitude of them to the Christian faith. But the persecution and oppression, which Ulfilas and his converts suffered through Athanaric, became so great that he applied to Constantinus in 348 for permission to lead his converts into Roman territory. Constantinus readily granted the request, and Ulfilas accordingly led a great number of his people across the Danube, and settled near Nicopolis in Moesia, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, where he preached and laboured until his death, which took place in 383 while on a visit to Constantinople.

    By far the most important source of our knowledge of the life and work of Ulfilas is found in the account of him given by Auxentius, from which we extract the following passage (for the full account the reader must be referred to the work: <bibl>‘Über das Leben und die Lehre des Ulfila,’ by <author>G. Waitz</author>, Hannover, 1840</bibl>).

    ‘Eo <hi>ita praedic</hi>ante et per Cristum cum dilectione deo patri gratias agente haec et his similia exsequente, quadraginta annis<pb n="196"/>in episcopatu gloriose florens, apostolica gratia grecam et latinam et goticam linguam sine intermissione in una et sola eclesia Cristi predicavit, quia et una est eclesia dei vivi, columna et firmamentum veritatis, et unum esse gregem Cristi domini et dei nostri, unam culturam et unum aedificium, unam virginem et unam sponsam, unam reginam et unam vineam, unam domum, unum templum, unum conventum esse Cristianorum, cetera vero <hi>omnia</hi> conventicula non esse eclesias dei, sed synagogas esse satanae adserebat et contestabatur. Et haec omnia de divinis scribturis eum dixisse et nos describsisse qui legit intelligat. Qui et ipsis tribus linguis plures tractatus et multas interpretationes volentibus ad utilitatem et ad aedificationem, sibi ad aeternam memoriam et mercedem post se dereliquid. Quem condigne laudare non sufficio et penitus tacere non audeo; cui plus omnium ego sum debitor, quantum et amplius in me laborabit, qui me a prima etate mea a parentibus meis discipilum suscepit et sacras litteras docuit et veritatem manifestavit et per misericordiam dei et gratiam Cristi et carnaliter et spiritaliter ut filium suum in fide educavit.’

    Sokrates expressly mentions that Ulfilas invented the Gothic alphabet, and that he translated the whole of the Scriptures into Gothic, with the exception of the four books of Kings, which he is said to have omitted so as not to excite the warlike spirit of his people. The latter remark was no doubt a pure invention on the part of Sokrates, because the books of Joshua and Judges would have even been more likely to stimulate the Gothic passion for fighting than the books of Kings. The probability is, as Bradley points out, that Ulfilas did not live to finish his translation, and that he intended to leave to the last the books which he thought least important for his great purpose of making good Christians.

  <p>
    The Manuscripts, containing the fragments of the biblical translation which have come down to us, are not contemporary with Ulfilas; but were written in Italy about the year 500. The fragments of the New Testament all point to one and the same translator, but the two small fragments of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah differ so much in style from those of the New Testament, that scholars now regard them as being the work of a later translator. It is also highly improbable that Ulfilas was the author of the fragments of a commentary on the Gospel of St. John, first published by Massmann under the title: <bibl>‘Skeireins aíwaggēljōns þaírh Jōhannēn,’ Munich, 1834</bibl>. See<pb n="197"/>also: <bibl>Die Bruchstücke der Skeireins herausgegeben und erläutert von E. Dietrich, Strassburg, 1903</bibl>.

        For a faithfully printed copy of the various Manuscripts all later editors of Ulfilas are especially indebted to the edition by A.
