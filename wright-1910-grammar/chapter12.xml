      § 259. The most difficult chapter in works on comparative grammar is the one dealing with the pronouns. It is impossible to state with any degree of certainty how<pb n="119"/>many pronouns the parent Indg. language had and what forms they had assumed at the time it became differentiated into the various branches which constitute the Indg. family of languages. The difficulty is rendered still more complicated by the fact that most of the pronouns, especially the personal and demonstrative, must have had accented and unaccented forms existing side by side in the parent language itself; and that one or other of the forms became generalized already in the prehistoric period of the individual branches of the parent language. And then at a later period, but still in prehistoric times, there arose new accented and unaccented forms side by side in the individual branches, as e.g. in prim. Germanic ek, mek beside ik, mik. The separate Germanic languages generalized one or other of these forms before the beginning of the oldest literary monuments and then new accented beside unaccented forms came into existence again. And similarly during the historic periods of the different languages. Thus, e.g. the OE. for I is ic, this became in ME. ich accented form beside i unaccented form, ich then disappeared in standard ME. (but it is still preserved in one of the modern dialects of Somersetshire) and i came to be used as the accented and unaccented form. At a later period it became ī when accented and remained i when unaccented. The former has become NE. I, and the latter has disappeared from the literary language, but it is still preserved in many northern Engl. dialects, as i. In these dialects i is regularly used in interrogative and subordinate sentences; the ME. accented form ī has become ai and is only used in the dialects to express special emphasis, and from it a new unaccented form a has been developed which can only be used in making direct assertions. Thus in one and the same dialect (Windhill, Yorks.) we arrive at three forms: ai, a, i, which are never mixed up syntactically by genuine native dialect<pb n="120"/>speakers. Something similar to what has happened and still is happening in the modern dialects must also have taken place in the prehistoric and historic periods of all the Indg. languages; hence in the prehistoric forms of the pronouns given below it must not be assumed that they were the only ones existing in prim. Germanic. They are merely given as the nearest ascertainable forms from which the Gothic forms were descended.

        § 261. In the parent language the nom. was rarely used except to express emphasis (cp. Skr. Lat. and Gr.), because it was sufficiently indicated by the personal endings of the verb. Beside the accented form of each case of the personal pronouns, there also existed one or more unaccented forms just as in many modern dialects, where we often find three or even four forms for the nom. case of each pronoun. It is impossible to determine whether forms like ik, mik, mis, and þu, þuk, þus, jus represent the original accented or unaccented forms, because prim. Germanic e became i in Gothic both in accented (§ 66) and unaccented syllables (§ 107), and u, ū were not distinguished in writing (§ 3). Forms with medial -z- like izwis, izōs, izē, &amp;c. represent unaccented forms (§ 136). The -k in mik, þuk, sik (§ 262) goes back to a prim. Germanic emphatic particle *ke = Indg. *ge, which is found in Gr. pronominal forms like ἐμέγε, me indeed. The gen. of the sing., dual and plural of the first and second persons probably represents the nom. acc. neut. pl. of the corresponding possessive pronouns (§ 263), which came to be used for the gen. of the personal pronouns. The origin of the final -s in mis, þus, sis, and of the -is in unsis, izwis, ugkis, igqis is unknown.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prim. Germanic *ek (O.Icel. ek, cp. Lat. ego, Gr. ἐγώ): *ik (OE. ic, OS. ik, OHG. ih); *mek: *mik (O.Icel. OS. mik, OHG. mih); *mes: *miz (OS. mī̌, OHG. mir); *wīs (Goth. weis): *wiz (OS. Wī̌, OHG. wir); *unz (= OE. OS. ūs, OHG. uns, Indg. *ns with vocalic n, § 54), the unaccented form of *nes = Skr. nas, us; *unsiz formed from Goth. uns + iz; Goth. OE. OS. wi-t, O.Icel. vi-t are unaccented plural forms with the addition of -t which is of obscure origin; *uƞ-kiz (§ 158) where uƞ- = the un- in un-s, cp. OE. unc, OS. unk. *þū (Lat. tū, O.Icel. OE. þū, OS. thū, OHG. dū): *þu (Gr. σύ, OE. þu, OS. thu, OHG. du); *þek (? OE. þec): *þik (O.Icel. þik, OS. thik,<pb n="122"/>OHG. dih), the Goth. acc. and dat. had u from the nominative; *þes: *þiz (OS. thī̌, OHG. dir); *jūs (Lith. jũs): *juz, Goth. may represent either form. It is doubtful what were the original forms of izwis and igqis (OE. inc, OS. ink).

      <p>
        Nom. sing. is (Lat. is); in-a (O.Lat. im, OS. ina, OHG. in), the final -a from prim. Germanic -ō is originally a preposition governing the acc. case like Skr. ā́, up to, used after accusatives; and similarly in ita, þata, þana (§ 265), ƕana (§ 273), the -ō is regularly preserved in ƕanōh (§ 275), ƕarjanōh, ƕarjatōh (§ 275), þisƕanōh (§ 276); it-a (Lat. id, OS. it, OHG. iȥ); gen. is from Indg. *eso (OHG. OS. is with i from in, iȥ; ina, it); imma from the Indg. instr. *esmē, -ō (OS. OHG. imu, -ō) with the assimilation of -sm- to -mm- after vowels; and similarly in þamma (§ 265), ƕamma (§ 273), ƕammēh (§ 275) where the -ē is regularly preserved. eis, ins, im (OS. OHG. im), neut. nom. acc. pl. ija, from prim. Germanic *īs, ins, im-, *ijō older *ijā; izē, formed from the gen. sing. is + the gen. ending -ē (§§ 87 (1), 179), and similarly OS. OHG. iro with -o from older -ō̃n. The original Indg. gen. pl. was *eisō̃m which would have become *eizō in Goth. and *īro in OS. OHG.
      </p>

      <p>
        *sī (Gr. ī̃, O.Ir. OHG. sī): *si (Goth. OHG. si); ija from *ijōn older *ijām (cp. bandja, § 193); izōs from *ezō̃z older *esā̃s (cp. gibōs, § 191); izái = Indg. *esāĩ (cp. gibái); ijōs = Indg. *ijā̃s (cp. bandjōs); izō, formed from the iz- in the gen. sing. + the gen. ending -ō, cp. the similar formation of OS. OHG. iro. The regular form would have been *eizō, see above.

        The reflexive pronoun originally referred to the chief person of the sentence (generally the subject), irrespectively as to whether the subject was the first, second, or third person singular or plural. This usage remained in Sanskrit, but in the Germanic languages the pronouns of the first and second person came to be used reflexively already in prim. Germanic, and then the original reflexive pronoun became restricted to the third person. In Goth. sik, seina, sis were used for both numbers and all genders. sik from prim. Germ. se+ke (§ 261), OHG. sih, cp. Gr. ἕ from *σε, Lat. sē; seina is of the same origin as meina, þeina (§ 261); on sis see § 261.

        § 263. The possessive pronouns meins, my; þeins, thy; *seins, his, are originally old locatives, Indg. *mei, *tei, *sei with the addition of the nominal suffix -no-, whence prim. Germanic masc. nom. *mīnaz, *þīnaz, *sīnaz; fem. nom. *mīnō, *þīnō, *sīnō. Only the acc. gen. dat. sing. and pl. of *seins occur. This form of the possessive pronoun is only used when it relates to the subject of its own sentence. When it relates to any word other than the subject of its own sentence, it is expressed by the gen. case of the personal pronoun masc. and neut. sing. is, plural izē; fem. sing. izōs, plural izō. The nom. of the third person for both sing. and plural all genders is expressed by the gen. case of the personal pronoun (§ 260). See § 431.
      </p>

      <p>
        The remaining possessive pronouns were formed from the personal pronouns by means of the Indg. comparative suffix -ero-, prim. Germanic -era-, as unsar, our; *ugkar, of us two; izwar, your; igqar, of you two.

              3. Besides the nom. sing. forms saei, sōei, there also occur forms made from the personal pronouns, thus masc. izei (from is + ei); fem. sei (from si + ei), which is more frequently met with than sōei. Instead of izei the form izē occasionally occurs (cp. § 5). The form izei (izē) is sometimes also used for the nom. pl. masc.; þái sind þái izē, these are they who; atsaíƕip faúra liugnapraúfētum þáim izei qimand at izwis, beware of false prophets, of them who come to you.

            <p>
              Some scholars assume that sei is an indeclinable demonstrative particle representing an old locative like Latin sī, if; sic from *sei-ke, so, thus; and that izei is from an older *e-sei (cp. Gr. ἐ-κεῖ, there), where e- is the pronominal stem mentioned in § 270. At a later period sei and izei came to be regarded as compounds of si + ei and is + ei. This theory has much in its favour, because it explains why sei and izei have no oblique cases and why izei is used for the masc. nom. singular and plural.
