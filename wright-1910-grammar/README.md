# Wright's 1910 Grammar of the Gothic Language

## Example

Consider the following scan from Wright's book:

I'm taking the raw text:

and marking it up something like this:

Note that this is just the work-in-progress hand markup and is subject to change.

But once this is done, not only can I produce a nice HTML version:

(eventually linkable) but I can start to extract machine-actionable language data such as sound and word correspondences.

Paradigms and lexical information will also be extractable.
