        § 149. Germanic w remained initially before vowels and also initially before and after consonants except in the combinations kw (§ 163) and χw (§ 165), as wigs, O.Icel. vegr, OE. OS. OHG. weg, way; wulfs, OE. OS. wulf,<pb n="71"/>OHG. wolf, wolf; wlits, OE. wlite, O.S. wliti, face, look, beauty; wraka, OE. wracu, revenge, persecution; swistar, OE. sweostor, OS. OHG. swester, sister; and similarly wahsjan, to grow; waírs, worse; waúrd, word; wrikan, to persecute; dwals, foolish; twái, two; twalif, twelve; þwahan, to wash.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also remained:
        <list>
          <item>
            (1) Medially before vowels, as fidwōr, four; hawi, hay; nidwa, nest; siggwan, to sing; slawan, to be silent; sparwa, sparrow; taíhswō, right hand; gen. kniwis, OE. cneowes, OHG. knewes, of a knee; mawi, girl; þiwi, maid-servant; tawida, he did; nom. pl. masc. qiwái, alive; fawái, few; sniwan, to hasten.
          </item>
          <item>
            (2) Medially between a long vowel, diphthong, or consonant and a following j or s, as lēwjan, to betray; hnáiwjan, to abase; hnáiws, lowly; snáiws, snow; ufarskadwjan, to overshadow.
          </item>
          <item>
            (3) Finally after long vowels, diphthongs, and consonants, as lēw, occasion; hláiw, grave; fráiw, seed; waúrstw (cp. § 29), work.

        § 150. Germanic w became u after a short vowel with which it combined to form a diphthong: (1) Finally, as kniu, knee; triu, wood; beside gen. kniwis, triwis; pret. snáu, he hastened, beside inf. sniwan. (2) Before consonants, as gen. máujōs, þiujōs, beside nom. mawi, girl; þiwi, maid-servant; inf. táujan, to do, beside pret. tawida; náus, corpse, beside nom. pl. naweis; siuns from *se(ʒ)wnís, sight, face. It also became u before -s, older -z, after the loss of an intervening vowel, as skadus from *skadwaz, shadow.

        § 151. In a few instances medial -w- (or -ww- the origin of which is uncertain) after short vowels became -ggw- in Gothic and -ggv-, -gg- in O.Icel., whereas the West-Germanic languages<pb n="72"/>developed an u before this -w- which united with the preceding vowel to form a diphthong, or ū (when the preceding vowel was u). The conditions under which this sound-change took place have not yet been satisfactorily explained. The examples are:—Goth. bliggwan, OE. *blēowan, OHG. bliuwan, to strike; Goth. triggws, O.Icel. tryggr, OE. trīewe, OS. OHG. triuwi, true, faithful, cp. also Goth. triggwaba, truly, triggwa, covenant; Goth. *glaggwus, exact, accurate, O.Icel. glöggr, OE. glēaw, OHG. glau (inflected form glauwēr), wise, prudent; cp. also Goth. glaggwō (av.), diligently, glaggwuba (av.), diligently, accurately; Goth. skuggwa, O.Icel. skugg-sjā, mirror, OE. scūwa, OHG. scūwo, shade, shadow.

          § 152. Germanic j remained in Gothic:
          <list>
            <item>
              (1) Initially, as juggs, OS. OHG. jung, young; jēr, year; juk, yoke.
            </item>
            <item>
              (2) Medially between vowels which remained as such in the historic period of the language, except in the combination ǣj +vowel, as frijōnds, friend; fijan, to hate; ija (acc.), her; þrija (neut.), three; stōjan, to judge. For the treatment of ǣj in Goth. see § 76.
            </item>
            <item>
              (3) Medially between a consonant and a following guttural vowel which remained as such in the historic period of the language, as lēwjan, to betray; frawardjan, to destroy; harjōs, armies; haírdjōs, shepherds; nasjan, to save; sōkjan, to seek. Cp. § 157.

      </div>

      <div type="section" n="153">
        <p>
          § 153. Medial -ij- became -ī- before -s, older -z, after the loss of a vowel in final syllables, as nom. haírdeis from *χirđij-az, shepherd; freis from *frij-az, free; gasteis from *ʒastij-iz, guests = Lat. hostēs from *hostejes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Germanic -iji- from older -eje-, -ije- became i(j)i = ī after long closed stem-syllables and after unaccented syllables, but -ji- in other cases, as sōkeis, thou seekest, from *sōki(j)izi = Indg. *sāgéjesi; sōkeiþ, he seeks, from<pb n="73"/>*sōki(j)iđi = Indg. *sāgéjeti; and similarly frawardeiþ, he destroys; mikileiþ, he praises; gen. sing. haírdeis from *χirđi(j)iz, older -ijes (with pronominal ending (§ 265)); láisareis, teacher; ragineis, counsellor; dáupeins, baptism, from *đaupi(j)iniz, older -ejenis; beside nasjis, nasjiþ, inf. nasjan, to save; stōjis, stōjiþ, inf. stōjan, to judge.
        </p>

        <div type="note">
            Note.—The gen. and dat. sing. of the long and polysyllabic -jan- stems of nouns and adjectives were remodelled after the analogy of the short stems, as fiskjins, fiskjin (§ 208), wilþjins, wilþjin (§238) for *fiskeins, *fiskein, *wilþeins, *wilþein, after the analogy of forms like wiljins, wiljin, midjins, midjin. See also § 183. On the other hand in the fem. abstract nouns formed from the first class of weak verbs (§ 200), those with short stems were remodelled after the analogy of those with long stems, as naseins for *nasjins after the analogy of forms like dáupeins, láiseins.

      </div>

      <div type="section" n="154">
        <p>
          § 154. Final -ī which arose from medial -ij- after the loss of a final vowel or syllable was shortened to i (cp. § 89), as voc. haírdi from *χirđij(i), older -ije; acc. haírdi from *χirđij-an. In like manner we should expect the imperative 2 pers. sing. of the first class of weak verbs to end in -i, as *sōki, seek thou; *hazi, praise thou, from *sōkij(i), *χazij(i), older -eje-, cp. Gr. φόβει from * φόβε(j)ε, frighten thou. It is difficult to account for sōkei, hazei unless we may assume either that they were new formations from the 2 pers. sing. pres. indic. of verbs with long closed stem-syllables and of simple trisyllabic verbs or else that forms like voc. acc. sing. haírdi were new formations formed after the analogy of forms like voc. acc. sing. hari (§ 155).

      </div>

      <div type="section" n="155">
        <p>
          § 155. When medial -j- came to stand finally after the loss of a final vowel or syllable, it became -i, as voc. sing. hari, from *χarj(i); acc. sing. hari from *χarj-an, army; nom. acc. sing. kuni from *kunj-an, race, generation.

      </div>

      <div type="section" n="156">
        <p>
          § 156. In a few words medial -j- (or -jj- the origin of which is uncertain) after short vowels became -ddj- in<pb n="74"/>Gothic, and -ggj-, -gg- in O.Icel., whereas the West-Germanic languages developed an i before this -j-, which united with the preceding vowel to form a diphthong, or ī (when the preceding vowel was i). A satisfactory explanation of this sound-law has not yet been found. The examples are:—gen. Goth. twaddjē, O.Icel. tveggja, OHG. zweio, of two, cp. Skr. dváyōs; Goth. waddjus, O.Icel. veggr, wall, related to Lat. viēre, to plait; Goth. iddja, I went, cp. Skr. áyām, I went; Goth. daddjan, to suckle, cp. Skr. dháyāmi, I suckle.

          § 157. In Indg. -j- alternated with -ij-. The former occurred after short and the latter after long syllables, as Gr. μέσος, μέσσος from *μέθjος, Skr. madhyas, Indg. *medhjos, middle, beside Gr. πάτριος from *πάτριjος, Skr. pítriyas, Indg. *pətrijos, paternal. This original distinction was not fully preserved in Gothic, because the -ij- became simplified to -j- before guttural vowels which remained as such in the historic period of the language, as nom. pl. haírdjōs from *χirđ(i)jōz, shepherds; and similarly in the other plural forms and in the dat. singular (§ 184).
        </p>

        <p>
          Prim. Germanic -ij- from Indg. -ej- had become -j- before guttural vowels in the prehistoric period of all the Germanic languages, as nasjan, to save; sōkjan, to seek = Indg. *nosejonom, *sāgejonom; pres. first pers. sing. nasja, sōkja = Indg. *nosejō, *sāgejō; pl. nasjam, sōkjam.

      <div type="note">
        <p>
          Note.—Medial -mn- became -Ҍn- which remained when the preceding syllable began with a voiceless consonant, but became -fn- by dissimilation when the preceding syllable began with a voiced consonant, as witubni, knowledge; fastubni, observance, fasting; fráistubni, temptation; stibna, voice, cp. OHG. stimna; wundufni, wound, plague; waldufni, power, might. See § 386.

In modern philological works the sound in question is transcribed by q. Examples are:—qēns, O.Icel. kvān, OE. cwēn, OS. quān, wife,<pb n="78"/>woman; qiþan, O.Icel. kveða, OE. cweþan, OS. queðan, OHG. quedan, to say; and similarly qiman, to come; riqis, darkness; naqaþs, naked; sigqan, to sink; sagq, he sank.

It probably also became an aspirate in Gothic medially between vowels. Examples are:—haban, O.Icel. hafa, OE. habban, OHG. habēn, to have; faíhu, OE. feoh, OHG. fihu, cattle, property; and similarly haírtō, heart; hafjan, to raise; hund, hundred; taíhun, ten; þeihan, to thrive.

          Medial and final χw also became ƕ in Gothic, but in O.Icel. and the West Germanic languages it became χ. For examples see § 143.

            Note.—The reasons for assuming that Goth. ƕ was a simple sound, and not a compound one composed of h + w, are:—

            <list>
              <item>

              <item>
                (2) Ulfilas wrote hw only in compound words where h and w came together by composition, e.g. ubuhwōþida = uf + uh + wōpida, and he cried out; þaírhwakandans = paírh + wakandans (pres. part. nom. acc. pl. of wakan, to wake, watch).
              </item>
              <item>
                (3) The principal parts of saíƕan, to see, are the same as those of strong verbs with stems ending in a single consonant other than a nasal or liquid (§ 307).
              </item>
              <item>

          § 166. Prim. Germanic g, which only occurred after ŋ (§ 132), remained in Gothic as in the other Germanic languages, as tuggō, OE. tunge, OS. tunga, OHG. zunga, tongue; and similarly briggan, to bring; figgrs, finger; huggrjan, to hunger; laggs, long.

          § 167. The changes which Germanic ʒ underwent in Gothic cannot be determined with perfect certainty. For the history of ʒ in the other Germanic languages, see § 133. Initially, and medially after consonants, it probably became g, as Goth. OE. guma, O.Icel. gumi, OS. gumo, OHG. gomo, man; baírgan, O.Icel. bjarga, OE. beorgan, OHG. bergan, to hide; and similarly gasts, guest; giban, to give; gōþs, good; grētan, to weep; faírguni, mountain; tulgus, steadfast; azgō, ash, cinder.

This change of ʒ to χ can be assumed from the corresponding Gothic treatment of Ҍ (§ 161) and đ (§ 173). Examples are acc.<pb n="80"/>sing. dag, day; wig, way; ōg, I fear; mag, he can, may; nom. sing. dags, wigs; manags, much, many; baúrgs, city.

        </p>

        <p>
          đ became þ after vowels both finally and before final -s; hence the frequent interchange between đ (written d) and<pb n="81"/>þ in inflexion, as inf. beidan, to abide, await; ana-biudan, to command; bidjan, to pray, beside pret. sing. báiþ, -báuþ, baþ; gen. sing. gōdis, háubidis, nasidis, beside nom. sing. gōþs, good, háubiþ, head, nasiþs (pp.), saved.

          § 175. z only occurred medially and finally in prim. Germanic (§§ 137, 141). Medial z, which became r in the other Germanic languages, generally remained in Gothic, as huzd, OE. OS. hord, OHG. hort, treasure; máiza, OE. māra, OS. mēra, OHG. mēro, more, greater; and similarly azgō, ash, cinder; razda, speech; mizdō, pay, reward; alþiza, older; hazjan, to praise; talzjan, to instruct.
        </p>

        <div type="note">
          <p>
            Note.—In the forms of strong verbs, medial z was supplanted by s through the levelling out of the s-forms, e. g. kusum, kusans for *kuzum, *kuzans, after the analogy of kiusan, káus, &amp;c., see § 137.
          </p>
          <p>
            z was also supplanted by s in several weak verbs, which in<pb n="82"/>some cases was due to the influence of the corresponding strong verbs, as nasjan, for *nazjan, after the analogy of nisan, cp. OE. nerian, OHG. nerien, to save; ur-ráisjan, to raise up, sv. ur-reisan, to arise, cp. OE. rǣran, to raise; láisjan, cp. OE. lǣran, OHG. lēren, to teach; wasjan, to clothe, cp. OE. werian, OHG. werien, to wear, see § 137 note.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Germanic final -z became -s in Gothic, as gen. diuz-is, riqiz-is, but nom. dius, wild beast; riqis, darkness; nom. sing. dags, from *đaʒaz, day; gasts from *ʒastiz, guest; nom. pl. dagōs from *đaʒōz; gasteis from *ʒastīz; nom. sing. akrs from *akraz, field; nimis from *nimiz(i), thou takest. This -s was dropped when it came to stand after an original s through the loss of a vowel, as waírs from *wirs(i)s older *wirsiz (av.), worse, cp. adj. waírsiza, worse; nom. drus (gen. drusis) from *drusiz, fall; láus, empty, but gen. láusis; freihals, freedom, but gen. freihalsis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Final -s(-z) was dropped after a short vowel + consonantal r, cp. nom. sing. waír, man; baúr, son; anþar, second; unsar, our, &amp;c., beside nom. sing. dags, day; gasts, guest; akrs, field; swērs, honoured; skeirs, clear; gen. brōþrs, of a brother, &amp;c.
        </p>                

        <p>
          Final -(i)z also disappeared in the dat. pl. (originally instrumental) ending of nouns, adjectives and pronouns, if we are right in assuming that the ending was originally -mis = prim. Germanic -miz, as in dagam, gibōm, gastim, brōþrum, blindáim, þáim. But the original ending may have been simply -mi. And similarly in the first pers. pl. of the pres. indic. which originally ended in -mes, -mos = prim. Germanic -miz, -maz (§ 287).

                Note.—1. The z, in such forms as riqiz, darkness; mimz, flesh, meat, beside the regular forms riqis, mims, was due to the levelling out of the stem-form of the oblique cases.

            <item>
              <p>
                2. Final -z remained when protected by a particle, cp. e.g. wileiz-u? wilt thou?; ƕaz-uh, each, every; iz-ei (rel. pr.), who;<pb n="83"/>uz-uh (prep.), whether from; beside wileis, thou wilt; ƕ as? who?; is, he; us, out, from.

            <item>
              <p>
                3. The prep. us became ur before r in compounds, as ur-reisan, to arise; ur-rinnan, to go out. The s in us- was sometimes dropped in compounds before st, as u-standan = us-standan, to stand up, cp. also di-skritnan, beside dis-kritnan, to be rent in twain.
