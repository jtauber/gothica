  <h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
  <h1>ALPHABET AND PRONUNCIATION.</h1>

  
    <p>
      <span class="section-label">§ 2.</span>
      The <span class="lang">Gothic</span> monuments, as handed down to us, are written in a peculiar alphabet which, according to the Greek ecclesiastical historians Philostorgios and Sokrates, was invented by Ulfilas. But Wimmer<span class="footnote">Wimmer, ‘Die Runenschrift,’ Berlin, 1887; pp. 259–74.</span> and others have clearly shown that Ulfilas simply took the <span class="lang">Greek</span> uncial alphabet as the basis for his, and that in cases where this was insufficient for his purpose he had recourse to the <span class="lang">Latin</span> and runic alphabets. The alphabetic sequence of the letters can be determined with certainty from the numerical values, which agree as nearly as possible with those of the <span class="lang">Greek</span>. Below are given the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> characters in the first line, in the second line their numerical values, and in the third line their transliteration in Roman characters.

          <p>
            <span class="note-label">Note.—</span>1. Two of the above 27 <span class="lang">Gothic</span> characters were used as numerals only, <span class="abbr">viz.</span> <span class="c">𐍁</span> = 90 and <span class="c">𐍊</span> = 900. The letter <span class="c">𐍇</span> occurs only in <span class="w">Xristus</span> (<span class="gloss">Christ</span>) and one or two other words, where <span class="c">𐍇</span> had probably the sound-value <span class="c">k</span>. The <span class="lang">Gothic</span> character <span class="c">𐌹̈</span> was used at the beginning of a word and medially after a vowel not belonging to the same syllable, thus <span class="w">𐌹𐌳𐌳𐌾𐌰</span>, <span class="w">iddja</span> (<span class="gloss">I went</span>); <span class="w">𐍆𐍂𐌰𐌹𐍄𐌹𐌸</span>, <span class="w">fra-itiþ</span> (<span class="gloss">he devours</span>).
          </p>
        
        
          <p>
            2. When the letters were used as numerals a point was placed before and after them, or a line above them, thus <span class="c">·𐌻·</span> <span class="c">𐌻̄</span>, <span class="c">·l·</span> <span class="c">l̄</span> = 30.
          </p>
        
        
          <p>
            3. In words borrowed from <span class="lang">Greek</span> containing <span class="c">υ</span> in the function of a vowel, it is transcribed by <span class="c">y</span>, thus <span class="w">συναγωγή</span>, <span class="w">synagōgē</span>, <span class="gloss">synagogue</span>. <span class="c">y</span> may be pronounced like the <span class="c">i</span> in <span class="lang">English</span> <span class="w">bit</span>. See <span class="ref">p. 360</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our transcription the letter <span class="c">þ</span> is borrowed from the <span class="lang">OE.</span> or O.Norse alphabet.

          <p>
            In some books <span class="c">q</span>, <span class="c">ƕ</span>, <span class="c">w</span> are represented by <span class="c">kw</span> (<span class="c">kv</span>), <span class="c">hw</span> (<span class="c">hv</span>), <span class="c">v</span> respectively.

    <h2>A. The Vowels.</h2>

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 3.</span>
        The <span class="lang">Gothic</span> vowel-system is represented by the five elementary letters <span class="c">a</span>, <span class="c">e</span>, <span class="c">i</span>, <span class="c">o</span>, <span class="c">u</span>, and the digraphs <span class="c">ei</span>, <span class="c">iu</span>, <span class="c">ai</span>, and <span class="c">au</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vowel-length was entirely omitted in writing. The sign ¯, placed over vowels, is here used to mark long vowels.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vowels <span class="c">e</span>, <span class="c">o</span> (uniformly written <span class="c">ē</span>, <span class="c">ō</span> in this grammar) were always long.
        <span class="c">a</span>, <span class="c">u</span> had both a short and a long quantity.
        <span class="c">i</span> was a short vowel, the corresponding long vowel of which was expressed by the digraph <span class="c">ei</span> after the analogy of the <span class="lang">Greek</span> pronunciation of <span class="c">ει</span> in the fourth century.
        <span class="c">iu</span> was a falling diphthong.
        Each of the digraphs <span class="c">ai</span>, <span class="c">au</span> was used without distinction in writing to express three different sounds which are here written <span class="c">ái</span>, <span class="c">aí</span>, <span class="c">ai</span> and <span class="c">áu</span>, <span class="c">aú</span>, <span class="c">au</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A brief description of the sound-values of the above<span class="pb">
<span>6</span></span>vowel-system will be given in the following paragraphs. Our chief sources for ascertaining the approximate quality and quantity of the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> simple vowels and diphthongs are:—
        (1) The pronunciation of the <span class="lang">Greek</span> and <span class="lang">Latin</span> alphabets as they obtained in the fourth century; the former of which was taken by Ulfilas as the basis for representing his own native sound-system.
        (2) A comparison of the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> spelling of <span class="lang">Greek</span> loan-words and proper names occurring in Ulfilas with the original <span class="lang">Greek</span> words.
        (3) The spelling of <span class="lang">Gothic</span> proper names found in <span class="lang">Greek</span> and <span class="lang">Latin</span> records of the fourth to the eighth century.
        (4) The occasional fluctuating orthography of one and the same word in the biblical translation.
        (5) Special sound-laws within the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> language itself.
        (6) The comparison of <span class="lang">Gothic</span> with the other Old Germanic languages.
      </p>
    

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 4.</span>
        <span class="c">a</span> had the same sound as the <span class="c">a</span> in <span class="lang">NHG.</span> <span class="w">mann</span>, as
        <span class="w">ahtáu</span>, <span class="gloss">eight</span>;
        <span class="w">akrs</span>, <span class="gloss">field</span>;
        <span class="w">dags</span>, <span class="gloss">day</span>;
        <span class="w">namō</span>, <span class="gloss">name</span>;
        <span class="w">giba</span>, <span class="gloss">gift</span>;
        <span class="w">waúrda</span>, <span class="gloss">words</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="c">ā</span> had the same sound as the <span class="c">a</span> in <span class="lang">English</span> <span class="w">father</span>. In native <span class="lang">Gothic</span> words it occurs only in the combination <span class="c">āh</span> (see <span class="ref">§ 59</span>), as
        <span class="w">fāhan</span>, <span class="gloss">to catch, seize</span>;
        <span class="w">brāhta</span>, <span class="gloss">I brought</span>;
        <span class="w">þāhō</span>, <span class="gloss">clay</span>.
      </p>
    

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 5.</span>
        <span class="c">ē</span> was a long close <span class="c">e</span>-sound, strongly tinctured with the vowel sound heard in <span class="lang">NHG.</span> <span class="w">sie</span>, <span class="gloss">she</span>.
        Hence we sometimes find <span class="c">ei</span> (that is <span class="c">ī</span>), and occasionally <span class="c">i</span>, written where we should etymologically expect <span class="c">ē</span>, and <em>vice versa</em>.
        These fluctuations occur more frequently in Luke than elsewhere;
        examples are:
        <span class="w">qeins</span> = <span class="w">qēns</span>, <span class="cite">Luke ii. 5</span>;
        <span class="w">faheid</span> = <span class="w">fahēþ</span>, <span class="cite">Luke ii. 10</span>.
        <span class="w">spēwands</span> = <span class="w">speiwands</span>, <span class="cite">Mark vii. 33</span>;
        <span class="w">miþþanē</span> = <span class="w">miþþanei</span>, <span class="cite">Luke ii. 43</span>;
        <span class="w">izē</span> = <span class="w">izei</span>, <span class="cite">Mark ix. 1</span>.
        <span class="w">birusjōs</span> = <span class="w">bērusjōs</span>, <span class="cite">Luke ii. 41</span>;
        <span class="w">duatsniwun</span> = <span class="w">duatsnēwun</span>, <span class="cite">Mark vi. 53</span>.
        <span class="w">usdrēbi</span> = <span class="w">usdribi</span>, <span class="cite">Mark v. 10</span>.
        Examples are:
        <span class="w">jēr</span>, <span class="gloss">year</span>;
        <span class="w">slēpan</span>, <span class="gloss">to sleep</span>;
        <span class="w">nēmum</span>, <span class="gloss">we took</span>;
        <span class="w">swē</span>, <span class="gloss">as</span>;
        <span class="w">hidrē</span>, <span class="gloss">hither</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 6.</span>
        <span class="c">i</span> was probably a short open vowel like the <span class="c">i</span> in <span class="lang">English</span> <span class="w">bit</span>, as
        <span class="w">ik</span>, <span class="gloss">I</span>;
        <span class="w">itan</span>, <span class="gloss">to eat</span>;
        <span class="w">fisks</span>, <span class="gloss">fish</span>;
        <span class="w">bindan</span>, <span class="gloss">to bind</span>;
        <span class="w">arbi</span>, <span class="gloss">heritage</span>;

        <span class="c">ō</span> was a long close vowel, strongly tinctured with the vowel sound heard in <span class="lang">NHG.</span> <span class="w">gut</span>, <span class="gloss">good</span>.
        Hence we occasionally find <span class="c">u</span> written where we should etymologically expect <span class="c">ō</span>, and <em>vice versa</em>, as

        As has already been pointed out in <span class="ref">§ 3</span>, the digraph <span class="c">ai</span> was used by Ulfilas without distinction in writing to represent three different sounds which were of threefold origin.
        Our means for determining the nature of these sounds are derived partly from a comparison of the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> forms in which they occur with the corresponding forms of the other Indo-Germanic languages, and partly from the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> spelling of <span class="lang">Greek</span> loan-words.
        The above remarks also hold good for the digraph <span class="c">au</span>, <span class="ref">§ 11</span>.

        According to the transcription adopted in <span class="ref">§ 2</span> the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> consonant-system is represented by the following letters, which are here re-arranged after the order of the <span class="lang">English</span> alphabet:—<span class="c">b</span>, <span class="c">d</span>, <span class="c">f</span>, <span class="c">g</span>, <span class="c">h</span>, <span class="c">ƕ</span>, <span class="c">j</span>, <span class="c">k</span>, <span class="c">l</span>, <span class="c">m</span>, <span class="c">n</span>, <span class="c">p</span>, <span class="c">q</span>, <span class="c">r</span>, <span class="c">s</span>, <span class="c">t</span>, <span class="c">þ</span>, <span class="c">w</span>, <span class="c">z</span>.

      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 14.</span>
        <span class="c">b</span> had a twofold pronunciation.
        Initially, as also medially and finally after consonants, it was a voiced explosive like <span class="lang">English</span> <span class="c">b</span>, as
        <span class="w">barn</span>, <span class="gloss">child</span>;

      <p>
        Medially after vowels it was a voiced bilabial spirant, and may be pronounced like the <span class="c">v</span> in <span class="lang">English</span> <span class="w">live</span>, which is a voiced labio-dental spirant, as

        <span class="c">d</span> had a twofold pronunciation.
        Initially, as also medially and finally after consonants, it was a voiced explosive like the <span class="c">d</span> in <span class="lang">English</span> <span class="w">do</span>, as
        <span class="w">dags</span>, <span class="gloss">day</span>;

        It may, however, be pronounced like the <span class="c">f</span> in <span class="lang">English</span> <span class="w">life</span>, which is labio-dental, as

        <span class="w">giban</span>, <span class="gloss">to give</span>;
        the same may also have been the pronunciation of <span class="c">g</span> in the combination vowel + <span class="c">g</span> + consonant (other than a guttural), as
        <span class="w">bugjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to buy</span>;

        <span class="w">áugō</span>, <span class="gloss">eye</span>;

      <p>
        Final postvocalic <span class="c">g</span> and <span class="c">g</span> in the final combination <span class="c">gs</span> was probably a voiceless spirant like the <span class="c">ch</span> in <span class="lang">NHG.</span> or in <span class="lang">Scotch</span> <span class="w">loch</span>, as
        <span class="w">dag</span> (<span class="grm">acc. sing.</span>), <span class="gloss">day</span>;

        <span class="abbr">Cp.</span> <span class="ref">§ 169</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before another guttural it was used to express a guttural nasal (<span class="c">ŋ</span>) like the <span class="c">γ</span> in <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="w">ἄγγελὸς</span>, <span class="gloss">angel</span>;
        <span class="w">ἄγχι</span>, <span class="gloss">near</span>;

        <span class="w">briggan</span>, <span class="gloss">to bring</span>;

        When it was the one, and when the other, can only be determined upon etymological grounds.
        Examples of the former are
        <span class="w">siggwan</span>, <span class="gloss">to sing</span>;
        <span class="w">aggwus</span>, <span class="gloss">narrow</span>;

        All the Indo-Germanic languages have partly pitch (musical) and partly stress accent, but one or other of the two systems of accentuation always predominates in each language, thus in <span class="lang">Sanskrit</span> and <span class="lang">Old Greek</span> the accent was predominantly pitch, whereas in the oldest periods of the Italic dialects, and the Keltic and Germanic languages,<span class="pb">
<span>14</span></span>the accent was predominantly stress. This difference in the system of accentuation is clearly seen in <span class="lang">Old Greek</span> and the old Germanic languages by the preservation of the vowels of unaccented syllables in the former and the weakening or loss of them in the latter. In the early period of the parent Indg. language, the stress accent must have been more predominant than the pitch accent, because it is only upon this assumption that we are able to account for the origin of the vowels <span class="c">ī̌</span>, <span class="c">ū̌</span>, <span class="c">ə</span> (<span class="ref">§ 35, Note 1</span>), the liquid and nasal sonants (<span class="ref">§§ 53–6</span>), and the loss of vowel often accompanied by a loss of syllable, as in <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="grm">gen.</span> <span class="w">πα-τρ-ός</span> beside <span class="grm">acc.</span> <span class="w">πα-τέρ-α</span>; <span class="w">πέτ-ομαι</span> beside <span class="w">ἐ-πτ-όμην</span>; <span class="lang">Gothic</span> <span class="grm">gen. pl.</span> <span class="w">aúhs-nē</span> beside <span class="grm">acc.</span> <span class="w">*aúhsa-ns</span>. It is now a generally accepted theory that at a later period of the parent language the system of accentuation became predominantly pitch, which was preserved in <span class="lang">Sanskrit</span> and <span class="lang">Old Greek</span>, but which must have become predominantly stress again in <span class="lang">prim. Germanic</span> some time prior to the operation of Verner’s law (<span class="ref">§ 136</span>).
      </p>

      <p>
        The quality of the accent in the parent language was partly ‘broken’ (acute) and partly ‘slurred’ (circumflex). This distinction in the quality of the accent was preserved in <span class="lang">prim. Germanic</span> in final syllables containing a long vowel, as is seen by the difference in the development of the final long vowels in historic times according as they originally had the ‘broken’ or ‘slurred’ accent (<span class="ref">§§ 87 (1), 89</span>).
      </p>

      <p>
        In the parent language the chief accent of a word did not always fall upon the same syllable of a word, but was free or movable as in <span class="lang">Sanskrit</span> and <span class="lang">Greek</span>, <span class="abbr">cp.</span> <span class="abbr">e. g.</span> <span class="lang">Gr.</span>
        <span class="grm">nom.</span> <span class="w">πατήρ</span>, <span class="gloss">father</span>,
        <span class="grm">voc.</span> <span class="w">πάτερ</span>,
        <span class="grm">acc.</span> <span class="w">πατέρα</span>;
        <span class="lang">Skr.</span> <span class="w">ḗmi</span>, <span class="gloss">I go</span>,
        <span class="grm">pl.</span> <span class="w">imás</span>, <span class="gloss">we go</span>.
        This free accent was still preserved in <span class="lang">prim. Germanic</span> at the time when Verner’s law operated, whereby the voiceless spirants became voiced when the vowel immediately preceding them did not bear the chief accent of the word (<span class="ref">§ 136</span>). At a later period of the <span class="lang">prim.<span class="pb">
<span>15</span></span>Germanic</span> language, the chief accent of a word became confined to the first syllable. This confining of the chief accent to the first syllable was the cause of the great weakening—and eventual loss—which the vowels underwent in unaccented syllables in the prehistoric period of the individual Germanic languages (<span class="ref">Ch. V</span>). And the extent to which the weakening of unaccented syllables has been carried in some of the Modern Germanic dialects is well illustrated by such sentences as:
        <span class="phr">as et it mọən</span>, <span class="gloss">I shall have it in the morning</span>;
        <span class="phr">ast ə dunt if id kud</span>, <span class="gloss">I should have done it if I had been able</span> (<span class="lang">West Yorks.</span>).
      </p>
    

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 33.</span>
        The rule for the accentuation of uncompounded words is the same in <span class="lang">Gothic</span> as in the oldest period of the other Germanic languages, <span class="abbr">viz.</span> the chief stress fell upon the first syllable, and always remained there even when suffixes and inflexional endings followed it, as
        <span class="w">áudags</span>, <span class="gloss">blessed</span>;
        <span class="w">niman</span>, <span class="gloss">to take</span>;
        <span class="w">reikinōn</span>, <span class="gloss">to rule</span>;
        the preterite of reduplicated verbs, as
        <span class="w">laílōt</span> : <span class="w">lētan</span>, <span class="gloss">to let</span>;
        <span class="w">haíháit</span> : <span class="w">háitan</span>, <span class="gloss">to call</span>;
        <span class="w">blindamma</span> (<span class="grm">masc. dat. sing.</span>), <span class="gloss">blind</span>;
        <span class="w">dagōs</span>, <span class="gloss">days</span>;
        <span class="w">gumanē</span>, <span class="gloss">of men</span>;
        <span class="w">nimanda</span>, <span class="gloss">they are taken</span>;
        <span class="w">barnilō</span>, <span class="gloss">little child</span>;
        <span class="w">bērusjōs</span>, <span class="gloss">parents</span>;
        <span class="w">brōþrahans</span>, <span class="gloss">brethren</span>;
        <span class="w">dalaþrō</span>, <span class="gloss">from beneath</span>;
        <span class="w">dáubiþa</span>, <span class="gloss">deafness</span>;
        <span class="w">mannisks</span>, <span class="gloss">human</span>;
        <span class="w">þiudinassus</span>, <span class="gloss">kingdom</span>;
        <span class="w">waldufni</span>, <span class="gloss">power</span>.
        The position of the secondary stress in trisyllabic and polysyllabic words fluctuated in <span class="lang">Gothic</span>, and with the present state of our knowledge of the subject it is impossible to formulate any hard and fast rules concerning it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In compound words it is necessary to distinguish between compounds whose second element is a noun or an adjective, and those whose second element is a verb.
        In the former case the first element had the chief accent in the parent Indg. language;
        in the latter case the first element had or had not the chief accent according to the position of the verb in the sentence.
        But already in <span class="lang">prim. Germanic</span> the second element of compound verbs nearly always had<span class="pb">
<span>16</span></span>the chief accent;
        a change which was mostly brought about by the compound and simple verb existing side by side.
        This accounts for the difference in the accentuation of such pairs as
        <span class="w">ándahafts</span>, <span class="gloss">answer</span> : <span class="w">andháfjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to answer</span>;
        <span class="w">ándanēms</span>, <span class="gloss">pleasant</span> : <span class="w">andníman</span>, <span class="gloss">to receive</span>.
      </p>
    

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 34.</span>
        As has been stated above, compound words, whose second element is a noun or an adjective, had originally the chief stress on the first syllable.
        This simple rule was preserved in <span class="lang">Gothic</span>, as
        <span class="w">frakunþs</span>, <span class="lang">OE.</span> <span class="w">fracuþ</span>, <span class="gloss">despised</span>;
        <span class="w">gaskafts</span>, <span class="lang">OHG.</span> <span class="w">gascaft</span>, <span class="gloss">creation</span>;
        <span class="w">unmahts</span>, <span class="gloss">infirmity</span>;
        <span class="w">ufkunþi</span>, <span class="gloss">knowledge</span>;
        <span class="w">usfilh</span>, <span class="gloss">burial</span>;
        <span class="w">akranaláus</span>, <span class="gloss">without fruit</span>;
        <span class="w">allwaldands</span>, <span class="gloss">the Almighty</span>;
        <span class="w">brūþfaþs</span>, <span class="gloss">bridegroom</span>;
        <span class="w">gistradagis</span>, <span class="gloss">to-morrow</span>;
        <span class="w">láushandus</span>, <span class="gloss">empty-handed</span>;
        <span class="w">twalibwintrus</span>, <span class="gloss">twelve years old</span>;
        <span class="w">þiudangardi</span>, <span class="gloss">kingdom</span>.
        But in compound verbs the second element had the chief stress, as
        <span class="w">atlagjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to lay on</span>;
        <span class="w">duginnan</span>, <span class="gloss">to begin</span>;
        <span class="w">frakunnan</span>, <span class="gloss">to despise</span>;
        <span class="w">gaqiman</span>, <span class="gloss">to assemble</span>;
        <span class="w">usfulljan</span>, <span class="gloss">to fulfil</span>.
        When, however, the first element of a compound verb was separated from the verb by one or more particles, it had the chief stress, as
        <span class="w">gá-u-ƕa-sēƕi</span>, <span class="cite">Mark viii. 23</span>
        <span class="w">díz-uhþan-sat</span>, <span class="cite">Mark xvi. 8</span>.
