        Germanic <span class="c">w</span> remained initially before vowels and also initially before and after consonants except in the combinations <span class="c">kw</span> (<span class="ref">§ 163</span>) and <span class="c">χw</span> (<span class="ref">§ 165</span>), as

        Germanic <span class="c">w</span> became <span class="c">u</span> after a short vowel with which it combined to form a diphthong:

        In a few instances medial <span class="c">-w-</span> (or <span class="c">-ww-</span> the origin of which is uncertain) after short vowels became <span class="c">-ggw-</span> in Gothic and <span class="c">-ggv-</span>, <span class="c">-gg-</span> in O.Icel., whereas the West-Germanic languages
        <span class="pb">
<span>72</span></span>
        developed an <span class="c">u</span> before this <span class="c">-w-</span> which united with the preceding vowel to form a diphthong, or <span class="c">ū</span> (when the preceding vowel was <span class="c">u</span>).
        The conditions under which this sound-change took place have not yet been satisfactorily explained.

          Germanic <span class="c">j</span> remained in Gothic:

            The gen. and dat. sing. of the long and polysyllabic <span class="c">-jan-</span> stems of nouns and adjectives were remodelled after the analogy of the short stems, as <span class="w">fiskjins</span>, <span class="w">fiskjin</span> (<span class="ref">§ 208</span>), <span class="w">wilþjins</span>, <span class="w">wilþjin</span> (<span class="ref">§ 238</span>) for <span class="w">*fiskeins</span>, <span class="w">*fiskein</span>, <span class="w">*wilþeins</span>, <span class="w">*wilþein</span>, after the analogy of forms like <span class="w">wiljins</span>, <span class="w">wiljin</span>, <span class="w">midjins</span>, <span class="w">midjin</span>.
            See also <span class="ref">§ 183</span>.
            On the other hand in the fem. abstract nouns formed from the first class of weak verbs (<span class="ref">§ 200</span>), those with short stems were remodelled after the analogy of those with long stems, as <span class="w">naseins</span> for <span class="w">*nasjins</span> after the analogy of forms like <span class="w">dáupeins</span>, <span class="w">láiseins</span>.

          Final <span class="c">-ī</span> which arose from medial <span class="c">-ij-</span> after the loss of a final vowel or syllable was shortened to <span class="c">i</span> (cp. <span class="ref">§ 89</span>), as
          voc. <span class="w">haírdi</span> from <span class="w">*χirđij(i)</span>, older <span class="m">-ije</span>;
          acc. <span class="w">haírdi</span> from <span class="w">*χirđij-an</span>.
          In like manner we should expect the imperative 2 pers. sing. of the first class of weak verbs to end in <span class="c">-i</span>, as
          <span class="w">*sōki</span>, <span class="gloss">seek thou</span>;

Gr. <span class="w">φόβει</span> from <span class="w">*φόβε(j)ε</span>, <span class="gloss">frighten thou</span>.
          It is difficult to account for <span class="w">sōkei</span>, <span class="w">hazei</span> unless we may assume either that they were new formations from the 2 pers. sing. pres. indic. of verbs with long closed stem-syllables and of simple trisyllabic verbs or else that forms like voc. acc. sing. <span class="w">haírdi</span> were new formations formed after the analogy of forms like voc. acc. sing. <span class="w">hari</span> (<span class="ref">§ 155</span>).

          <span class="section-label">§ 155.</span>
          When medial <span class="c">-j-</span> came to stand finally after the loss of a final vowel or syllable, it became <span class="c">-i</span>, as

          <span class="section-label">§ 156.</span>
          In a few words medial -j- (or -jj- the origin of which is uncertain) after short vowels became -ddj- in<span class="pb">
<span>74</span></span>Gothic, and -ggj-, -gg- in O.Icel., whereas the West-Germanic languages developed an i before this -j-, which united with the preceding vowel to form a diphthong, or ī (when the preceding vowel was i).
          A satisfactory explanation of this sound-law has not yet been found.
          The examples are:—gen. Goth. twaddjē, O.Icel. tveggja, OHG. zweio, of two, cp. Skr. dváyōs;

                (2)
                Ulfilas wrote hw only in compound words where h and w came together by composition, e.g. ubuhwōþida = uf + uh + wōpida, and he cried out;
                þaírhwakandans = paírh + wakandans (pres. part. nom. acc. pl. of wakan, to wake, watch).
              
              
                (3)
                The principal parts of saíƕan, to see, are the same as those of strong verbs with stems ending in a single consonant other than a nasal or liquid (<span class="ref">§ 307</span>).
              
              
                (4)
                ƕ is treated as a single consonant in reduplicated syllables, as

          After vowels both finally and before -s, ʒ probably became χ (= NHG. ch), but was written g.
          This change of ʒ to χ can be assumed from the corresponding Gothic treatment of Ҍ (<span class="ref">§ 161</span>) and đ (<span class="ref">§ 173</span>). Examples are

            z was also supplanted by s in several weak verbs, which in<span class="pb">

          Germanic final -z became -s in Gothic, as

          nom. sing. dags, from *đaʒaz, day;

          nimis from *nimiz(i), thou takest.
          This -s was dropped when it came to stand after an original s through the loss of a vowel, as
          waírs from *wirs(i)s older *wirsiz (av.), worse, cp. adj. waírsiza, worse;
          nom. drus (gen. drusis) from *drusiz, fall;
