  <h1>PROPER NAMES</h1>
  <p>
    The <span class="lang">Gothic</span> spelling and pronunciation of <span class="lang">Greek</span> proper names, and of loan-words generally, were intentionally excluded from the chapter on <span class="lang">Gothic</span> pronunciation, in order that what was necessary to be said on these points might be reserved for the Glossary of proper names. The following few remarks, which are mostly confined to the vowels in proper names, will be useful to the learner:—
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">α</span> is regularly represented by <span class="c">a</span>, as
    <span class="w">Ἀβιάθαρ</span>, <span class="w">Abiaþar</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἄννα</span>, <span class="w">Anna</span>;
    <span class="w">Βηθσφαγή</span>, <span class="w">Bēþsfagei</span>;
    <span class="w">Δημᾶς</span>, <span class="w">Dēmas</span>;
    <span class="w">Θωμᾶς</span>, <span class="w">þōmas</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰσαάκ</span>, <span class="w">Isak</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">ε</span> is regularly represented by <span class="c">aí</span>, as
    <span class="w">Ἔφεσος</span>, <span class="w">Aífaísō</span>;
    <span class="w">λεγεών</span>, <span class="w">Laígaíōn</span>;
    <span class="w">Πέτρος</span>, <span class="w">Paítrus</span>;
    <span class="w">Βεελζεβούλ</span>, <span class="w">Baíaílzaíbul</span>;
    but <span class="w">Βηθλεέμ</span>, <span class="w">Bēþlahaím</span>.
    Cp. <span class="ref">§ 10</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">ι</span> is represented by <span class="c">i</span> or <span class="c">ei</span>. No fixed rule can be laid down as to when it is represented by the one and when by the other. Examples of the former are:—
    <span class="w">Δεκάπολις</span>, <span class="w">Daíkapaúlis</span>;
    <span class="w">φιλητός</span>, <span class="w">Filētus</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰδουμαία</span>, <span class="w">Idumaia</span>;
    <span class="w">Συρία</span>, <span class="w">Syria</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰακώβ</span>, <span class="w">Iakōb</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰησοῦς</span>, <span class="w">Iēsus</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰωσήφ</span>, <span class="w">Iōsēf</span>;
    and of the latter:—
    <span class="w">Ἰκόνιον</span>, <span class="w">Eikaúniō</span>;
    <span class="w">Γαλιλαία</span>, <span class="w">Galeilaia</span>;
    <span class="w">Τιμόθεος</span>, <span class="w">Teimaúpaíus</span>;
    <span class="w">Σιδών</span>, <span class="w">Seidōn</span>;
    <span class="w">Σίμων</span>, <span class="w">Seimōn</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="c">ι</span> is represented by <span class="c">aí</span> in <span class="w">Kyreinaíus</span>, <span class="w">Κυρήνιος</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="c">ι</span> is sometimes represented by <span class="c">j</span> before a following vowel, as
    <span class="w">Ἰάειρος</span>, <span class="w">Jaeirus</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰαννῆς</span>, <span class="w">Janēs</span>;
    <span class="w">Μαρία</span>, <span class="w">Marja</span>, beside <span class="w">Maria</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">ο</span> is regularly represented by <span class="c">aú</span> in other than final syllables, as
    <span class="w">Ὀνησιφόρος</span>, <span class="w">Aúneiseifaúrus</span>;
    <span class="w">Βοανεργές</span>, <span class="w">Baúanaírgaís</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰόρδανος</span>, <span class="w">Iaúrdanus</span>;
    <span class="w">Σολομών</span>, <span class="w">Saúlaúmōn</span>.
    Cp. the beginning of <span class="ref">§ 11</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In final syllables it is regularly represented by <span class="c">u</span>, as<span class="pb">
<span>360</span></span>
    <span class="w">Αὔγουστος</span>, <span class="w">Agustus</span>;
    <span class="w">Μάρκος</span>, <span class="w">Markus</span>;
    <span class="w">φίλιππος</span>, <span class="w">Filippus</span>;
    <span class="w">Πέτρος</span>, <span class="w">Paítrus</span>.
    These and similar words are declined like <span class="w">sunus</span> (<span class="ref">§ 202</span>) in the singular, but are mostly declined like i-stems (<span class="ref">§§ 196, 198</span>) in the plural.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="c">ο</span> is represented by <span class="c">ō</span> in <span class="w">Aírmōgaínēs</span>, <span class="w">Ἐρμογένης</span>. The <span class="c">u</span> instead of <span class="c">aú</span> in <span class="w">Iaírusaúlyma</span>, <span class="w">Ἱεροσόλυμα</span> is due to the influence of the <span class="c">u</span> in <span class="w">Iaírusalēm</span>, <span class="w">Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">υ</span> is regularly represented by <span class="c">𐍅</span> in the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> alphabet, so that forms like <span class="w">φύγελος</span>, <span class="w">Συρία</span> ought properly to be transcribed by <span class="w">Fwgaílus</span>, <span class="w">Swria</span>, <span class="abbr">cp.</span> <span class="c">αυ</span>, <span class="c">ευ</span> below. It has however become usual in all grammars, glossaries, and editions of the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> text, to transcribe <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">υ</span> in the function of a vowel by <span class="c">y</span>. Inaccurate as this mode of transcription is, I have thought it advisable to adopt the usual transcription throughout this book. Examples are:—
    <span class="w">Τυχικός</span>, <span class="w">Tykeikus</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἱεροσόλυμα</span>, <span class="w">Iaírusaúlyma</span>;
    <span class="w">Ὑμέναιος</span>, <span class="w">Ymaínaius</span>;
    <span class="w">Συμεών</span>, <span class="w">Symaíōn</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="c">υ</span> is represented by <span class="c">aú</span> in <span class="w">Saúr</span>, <span class="w">Σύρος</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">η</span> is mostly represented by <span class="c">ē</span>, as <span class="w">Ἀσήρ</span>, <span class="w">Asēr</span>; <span class="w">Δημᾶς</span>, <span class="w">Dēmas</span>; <span class="w">φανουήλ</span>, <span class="w">Fanuēl</span>; <span class="w">Ἰησοῦς</span>, <span class="w">Iēsus</span>. It is also sometimes represented by <span class="c">ei</span> (<span class="abbr">cp.</span> <span class="ref">§ 5</span>), as <span class="w">Ὀνησιφόρος</span>, <span class="w">Aúnei-seifaúrus</span>; <span class="w">Κυρήνιος</span>, <span class="w">Kyreinaíus</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="c">η</span> is represented by <span class="c">ai</span> in <span class="w">Gaírgaísainus</span>, <span class="w">Γεργεσηνός</span>. And beside the regular form <span class="w">Bēþania</span>, <span class="w">Βηθανία</span>, we have the <span class="grm">dat.</span> form <span class="w">Biþaniin</span> (<span class="cite">Mark xi. 1</span>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">ω</span> is usually represented by <span class="c">ō</span>, as
    <span class="w">Ἰακώβ</span>, <span class="w">Iakōb</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰωσήφ</span>, <span class="w">Iōsēf</span>;
    <span class="w">Μωσῆς</span>, <span class="w">Mosēs</span>;
    <span class="w">Θωμᾶς</span>, <span class="w">Ϸōmas</span>;
    <span class="w">Σολομών</span>, <span class="w">Saúlaúmōn</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is represented by <span class="c">au</span> in <span class="w">Lauidja</span>, <span class="w">Λωΐς</span>; <span class="w">Trauada</span>, <span class="w">Τρῳάς</span>; <span class="abbr">cp.</span> the end of <span class="ref">§ 11</span>. And by <span class="c">ū</span> in <span class="w">Rūma</span>, <span class="lang">Lat.</span> <span class="w">Rōma</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">αι</span>, which was a long open <span class="c">e</span>-sound like the <span class="c">ǣ</span> in <span class="lang">OE.</span> <span class="w">slǣpan</span>, is regularly represented by <span class="c">ai</span>, as
    <span class="w">Ἀλφαῖος</span>, <span class="w">Alfaius</span>;
    <span class="w">Ναιμάν</span>, <span class="w">Naiman</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰδουμαία</span>, <span class="w">Idumaia</span>;
    <span class="w">Φαρισαῖος</span>, <span class="w">Fareisaius</span>;
    <span class="abbr">cp.</span> the close of <span class="ref">§ 10</span>.
  </p>
  <span class="pb">
<span>361</span></span>
  <p>
    <span class="c">αϊ</span> is represented by <span class="c">aei</span>, as
    <span class="w">Βηθσαϊδά</span>, <span class="w">Bēþsaeida</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἠσαΐας</span>, <span class="w">Ēsaeias</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">ει</span>, which was a long <span class="c">i</span>-sound, is regularly represented by <span class="c">ei</span> (<span class="ref">§ 3</span>), as
    <span class="w">Δαυείδ</span>, <span class="w">Daweid</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰάειρος</span>, <span class="w">Jaeirus</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">αυ</span> is represented by <span class="c">aw</span>, as
    <span class="w">Δαυείδ</span>, <span class="w">Daweid</span>;
    <span class="w">Παῦλος</span>, <span class="w">Pawlus</span>.
    <span class="w">Agustáu</span> (<span class="cite">Luke ii. 1</span>) is probably a mistake for <span class="w">Awgustáu</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">ευ</span> is represented by <span class="c">aíw</span>, as
    <span class="w">Εὐνίκη</span>, <span class="w">Aíwneika</span>;
    <span class="w">Λευΐς</span>, <span class="w">Laíwweis</span>;
    <span class="w">εὐαγγέλιον</span>, <span class="w">aíwaggēljō</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">ου</span>, which was a long close <span class="c">u</span>-sound, is regularly represented by <span class="c">u</span>, as
    <span class="w">Αὔγουστος</span>, <span class="w">Agustus</span>;
    <span class="w">Φανουήλ</span>, <span class="w">Fanuēl</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰδουμαία</span>, <span class="w">Idumaia</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰησοῦς</span>, <span class="w">Iēsus</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰούδας</span>, <span class="w">Iudas</span>;
    <span class="w">Καφαρναούμ</span>, <span class="w">Kafarnaum</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <span class="lang">Gothic</span> representation of the <span class="lang">Greek</span> consonants in proper names requires but little comment. The <span class="lang">Greek</span> consonants are generally represented by the corresponding <span class="lang">Gothic</span> equivalents, that is <span class="c">β</span>, <span class="c">γ</span>, <span class="c">δ</span>, <span class="c">ζ</span>, <span class="c">θ</span>, <span class="c">κ</span>, <span class="c">λ</span>, <span class="c">μ</span>, <span class="c">ν</span>, <span class="c">ξ</span>, <span class="c">π</span>, <span class="c">ρ</span>, <span class="c">σ</span> (<span class="c">ς</span>), <span class="c">τ</span>, <span class="c">φ</span>, <span class="c">ψ</span> are almost in every case regularly represented by <span class="c">b</span>, <span class="c">g</span>, <span class="c">d</span>, <span class="c">z</span>, <span class="c">þ</span>, <span class="c">k</span>, <span class="c">l</span>, <span class="c">m</span>, <span class="c">n</span>, <span class="c">ks</span>, <span class="c">p</span>, <span class="c">r</span>, <span class="c">s</span>, <span class="c">t</span>, <span class="c">f</span>, <span class="c">ps</span> respectively. For examples see the Glossary below. The following points require to be noticed:—
  </p>
  <p>
    The <span class="lang">Greek</span> spiritus asper is generally represented by <span class="c">h</span>, as
    <span class="w">Ἑλισαῖος</span>, <span class="w">Haíleisaius</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἡλίας</span>, <span class="w">Hēlias</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἡρωδιανός</span>, <span class="w">Hērōdianus</span>;
    it is however also occasionally omitted, as in <span class="w">Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>, <span class="w">Iaírusalēm</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <span class="c">h</span> has sometimes been inserted in the <span class="lang">Gothic</span> form between two vowels, as
    <span class="w">Ἀβραάμ</span>, <span class="w">Abraham</span>;
    <span class="w">Βηθλεέμ</span>, <span class="w">Bēþlahaím</span>;
    <span class="w">Ἰωάννης</span>, <span class="w">Iōhannēs</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">τ</span> we have <span class="c">þ</span> in
    <span class="w">Nazareiþ</span>, <span class="w">Ναζαρέτ</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">χ</span> is represented by <span class="c">X</span> in
    <span class="w">Xristus</span>, <span class="w">Χριστός</span>;
    but it is generally represented by <span class="c">k</span>, as
    <span class="w">Antiaúkia</span>, <span class="w">Ἀντιοχία</span>;
    <span class="w">Tykeikus</span>, <span class="w">Τυχικός</span>.
    On the other hand <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">κ</span> is represented by <span class="c">X</span> in
    <span class="w">Xrēskus</span>, <span class="w">Κρήσκης</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inflected forms of <span class="lang">Greek</span> proper names in <span class="lang">Gothic</span> are given in the Glossary below, so far as they occur in<span class="pb">
<span>362</span></span>the specimens which I have chosen. No hard and fast rule for the inflection of these words can be given, as they sometimes preserve the <span class="lang">Greek</span> endings, sometimes have <span class="lang">Gothic</span> endings, and sometimes have a mixture of the two. Most consistency prevails in nouns ending in the <span class="grm">nom.</span> in <span class="m">-us</span>, <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="m">-ος</span>; these usually follow the u-declension in the <span class="grm">sing.</span>, but the i-declension in the <span class="grm">plural</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the grammar I have followed the usual practice of regarding each of the digraphs <span class="c">ai</span>, <span class="c">au</span> (printed <span class="c">ái</span>, <span class="c">aí</span>, <span class="c">ai</span>; <span class="c">áu</span>, <span class="c">aú</span>, <span class="c">au</span> in this book) as representing three different sounds, see <span class="ref">§§ 10, 67, 69, 76, 83</span>; and <span class="ref">§§ 11, 71, 73, 80, 84</span>. Some scholars go so far as to assume that the Germanic diphthongs <span class="c">ai</span>, <span class="c">au</span> remained in <span class="lang">Gothic</span> in accented syllables, but became respectively long open <span class="c">ǣ</span> and long open <span class="c">ǭ</span> in other positions. It is not, however, improbable that the two diphthongs had become monophthongs in all positions at the time Ulfilas lived, just as e. g. <span class="c">αι</span> had become a monophthong in <span class="lang">Greek</span> at a much earlier period, although the <span class="c">αι</span> was retained in writing. It seems almost incredible that a man like Ulfilas, who showed such great skill in other respects, should have used <span class="c">ai</span> for a short open <span class="c">e</span>, a long open <span class="c">ǣ</span> and a diphthong; and <span class="c">au</span> for a short open <span class="c">o</span>, a long open <span class="c">ǭ</span> and a diphthong. Whereas, if we assume that the diphthongs had become monophthongs (<span class="c">ǣ</span>, <span class="c">ǭ</span>), there is nothing incongruous in his having used each of the digraphs to represent two sounds which only differed in quantity but not in quality. This will also account for the fact that he regularly transcribed <span class="lang">Greek</span> <span class="c">αι</span> by <span class="c">ai</span>, and <span class="c">αυ</span> by <span class="c">aw</span>, because in the former case the diphthong had become a monophthong, and in the latter case the second element of the original <span class="lang">Greek</span> diphthong had become a spirant which at a later period was pronounced <span class="c">v</span> before voiced and <span class="c">f</span> before voiceless sounds.
