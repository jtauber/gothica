  <h1>CHAPTER XII</h1>
  <h1>PRONOUNS</h1>

  
    <p>
      <span class="section-label">§ 259.</span>
      The most difficult chapter in works on comparative grammar is the one dealing with the pronouns.
      It is impossible to state with any degree of certainty how<span class="pb">
<span>119</span></span>many pronouns the parent Indg. language had and what forms they had assumed at the time it became differentiated into the various branches which constitute the Indg. family of languages.
      The difficulty is rendered still more complicated by the fact that most of the pronouns, especially the personal and demonstrative, must have had accented and unaccented forms existing side by side in the parent language itself;
      and that one or other of the forms became generalized already in the prehistoric period of the individual branches of the parent language.
      And then at a later period, but still in prehistoric times, there arose new accented and unaccented forms side by side in the individual branches, as e.g. in prim. Germanic <span class="w">ek</span>, <span class="w">mek</span> beside <span class="w">ik</span>, <span class="w">mik</span>.
      The separate Germanic languages generalized one or other of these forms before the beginning of the oldest literary monuments and then new accented beside unaccented forms came into existence again.
      And similarly during the historic periods of the different languages.
      Thus, e.g. the OE. for <span class="w">I</span> is <span class="w">ic</span>, this became in ME. <span class="w">ich</span> accented form beside <span class="w">i</span> unaccented form, <span class="w">ich</span> then disappeared in standard ME. (but it is still preserved in one of the modern dialects of Somersetshire) and <span class="w">i</span> came to be used as the accented and unaccented form.
      At a later period it became <span class="w">ī</span> when accented and remained <span class="w">i</span> when unaccented.
      The former has become NE. <span class="w">I</span>, and the latter has disappeared from the literary language, but it is still preserved in many northern Engl. dialects, as <span class="w">i</span>.
      In these dialects <span class="w">i</span> is regularly used in interrogative and subordinate sentences;
      the ME. accented form <span class="w">ī</span> has become <span class="w">ai</span> and is only used in the dialects to express special emphasis, and from it a new unaccented form <span class="w">a</span> has been developed which can only be used in making direct assertions.
      Thus in one and the same dialect (Windhill, Yorks.) we arrive at three forms: <span class="w">ai</span>, <span class="w">a</span>, <span class="w">i</span>, which are never mixed up syntactically by genuine native dialect<span class="pb">
<span>120</span></span>speakers.
      Something similar to what has happened and still is happening in the modern dialects must also have taken place in the prehistoric and historic periods of all the Indg. languages;
      hence in the prehistoric forms of the pronouns given below it must not be assumed that they were the only ones existing in prim. Germanic.
      They are merely given as the nearest ascertainable forms from which the Gothic forms were descended.

      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 261.</span>
        In the parent language the nom. was rarely used except to express emphasis (cp. Skr. Lat. and Gr.), because it was sufficiently indicated by the personal endings of the verb.
        Beside the accented form of each case of the personal pronouns, there also existed one or more unaccented forms just as in many modern dialects, where we often find three or even four forms for the nom. case of each pronoun.
        It is impossible to determine whether forms like <span class="w">ik</span>, <span class="w">mik</span>, <span class="w">mis</span>, and <span class="w">þu</span>, <span class="w">þuk</span>, <span class="w">þus</span>, <span class="w">jus</span> represent the original accented or unaccented forms, because prim. Germanic <span class="c">e</span> became <span class="c">i</span> in Gothic both in accented (<span class="ref">§ 66</span>) and unaccented syllables (<span class="ref">§ 107</span>), and <span class="c">u</span>, <span class="c">ū</span> were not distinguished in writing (<span class="ref">§ 3</span>).
        Forms with medial <span class="c">-z-</span> like <span class="w">izwis</span>, <span class="w">izōs</span>, <span class="w">izē</span>, &amp;c. represent unaccented forms (<span class="ref">§ 136</span>).
        The <span class="c">-k</span> in <span class="w">mik</span>, <span class="w">þuk</span>, <span class="w">sik</span> (<span class="ref">§ 262</span>) goes back to a prim. Germanic emphatic particle <span class="w">*ke</span> = Indg. <span class="w">*ge,</span> which is found in Gr. pronominal forms like <span class="w">ἐμέγε</span>, <span class="gloss">me indeed</span>.
        The gen. of the sing., dual and plural of the first and second persons probably represents the nom. acc. neut. pl. of the corresponding possessive pronouns (<span class="ref">§ 263</span>), which came to be used for the gen. of the personal pronouns.
        The origin of the final <span class="c">-s</span> in <span class="w">mis</span>, <span class="w">þus</span>, <span class="w">sis</span>, and of the <span class="c">-is</span> in <span class="w">unsis</span>, <span class="w">izwis</span>, <span class="w">ugkis</span>, <span class="w">igqis</span> is unknown.

        The reflexive pronoun originally referred to the chief person of the sentence (generally the subject), irrespectively as to whether the subject was the first, second, or third person singular or plural.
        This usage remained in Sanskrit, but in the Germanic languages the pronouns of the first and second person came to be used reflexively already in prim. Germanic, and then the original reflexive pronoun became restricted to the third person.
        In Goth. sik, seina, sis were used for both numbers and all genders. sik from prim. Germ. se+ke (§ 261), OHG. sih, cp. Gr. ἕ from *σε, Lat. sē; seina is of the same origin as meina, þeina (§ 261); on sis see § 261.

    <h3>3. Possessive.</h3>

    
      <p class="status-wip">
        § 263.
        The possessive pronouns
        meins, my;
        þeins, thy;
        *seins, his,
        are originally old locatives, Indg. *mei, *tei, *sei with the addition of the nominal suffix -no-, whence prim. Germanic masc. nom. *mīnaz, *þīnaz, *sīnaz; fem. nom. *mīnō, *þīnō, *sīnō.
        Only the acc. gen. dat. sing. and pl. of *seins occur.
        This form of the possessive pronoun is only used when it relates to the subject of its own sentence.
        When it relates to any word other than the subject of its own sentence, it is expressed by the gen. case of the personal pronoun masc. and neut. sing. is, plural izē;
        fem. sing. izōs, plural izō.
        The nom. of the third person for both sing. and plural all genders is expressed by the gen. case of the personal pronoun (§ 260).
        See § 431.
      </p>

      <p class="status-wip">
        The remaining possessive pronouns were formed from the personal pronouns by means of the Indg. comparative suffix -ero-, prim. Germanic -era-, as
        unsar, our;
        *ugkar, of us two;
        izwar, your;

              Instead of izei the form izē occasionally occurs (cp. § 5).
              The form izei (izē) is sometimes also used for the nom. pl. masc.;

              and that izei is from an older *e-sei (cp. Gr. ἐ-κεῖ, there), where e- is the pronominal stem mentioned in § 270.
              At a later period sei and izei came to be regarded as compounds of si + ei and is + ei.
              This theory has much in its favour, because it explains why sei and izei have no oblique cases and why izei is used for the masc. nom. singular and plural.
