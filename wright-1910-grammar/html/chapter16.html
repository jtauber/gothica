  <h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1>
  <h1>SYNTAX</h1>

  
    <h2>Cases.</h2>

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 426.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Accusative.</span>
        Transitive verbs govern the accusative as in other languages:
        <span class="phr">ga-saíƕiþ þana sunu mans</span>, <span class="gloss">ye shall see the son of man</span>;
        <span class="phr">akran baíran</span>, <span class="gloss">to bear fruit</span>;
        <span class="abbr">&amp;c.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        A few verbs take an accusative of kindred meaning, as
        <span class="phr">ōhtēdun sis agis mikil</span>, <span class="abbr">lit.</span> <span class="gloss">they feared great fear for themselves, they feared exceedingly</span>;
        <span class="phr">háifstei þō gōdōn háifst</span>, <span class="gloss">fight (thou) the good fight</span>;
        similarly
        <span class="phr">huzdjan huzda</span>, <span class="gloss">to treasure up treasures</span>;
        <span class="phr">waúrkjan waúrstwa</span>, <span class="gloss">to work works</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        An accusative of closer definition occurs very rarely in <span class="lang">Gothic</span>:
        <span class="phr">urrann sa dáuþa gabundans handuns jah fōtuns faskjam</span>, <span class="gloss">the dead man came forth bound as to hands and feet with bandages</span>;
        <span class="phr">standáiþ nu ufgaúdrdanái hupins izwarans sunjái</span>, <span class="gloss">stand therefore, girt as to your loins with truth</span>.
      </p>
      <span class="pb">
<span>183</span></span>
      <p>
        An accusative of the person is used with the impersonal verbs
        <span class="w">grēdōn</span>, <span class="gloss">to be hungry</span>;
        <span class="w">huggrjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to hunger</span>;
        <span class="w">paúrsjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to thirst</span>;
        and also with <span class="grm">gen.</span> of the thing
        <span class="phr">kar(a) ist</span>, <span class="gloss">there is a care, it concerns</span>,
        as
        <span class="phr">ni kar-ist ina þizē lambē</span>, <span class="gloss">he careth not for the sheep</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The space and time over which an action extends are expressed by the accusative,
        as
        <span class="phr">qēmun dagis wig</span>, <span class="gloss">they went a day’s journey</span>;
        <span class="phr">jabái ƕas þuk ananáupjái rasta áina, gaggáis miþ imma twōs</span>, <span class="gloss">if anyone (whosoever) shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him two</span>;
        <span class="phr">salida twans dagans</span>, <span class="gloss">he abode two days</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="w">láisjan</span> takes two accusatives, one of the person, and one of the thing taught,
        as
        <span class="phr">láisida ins in gajukōm manag</span>, <span class="gloss">he taught them many a thing in parables</span>.
        The following verbs and a few others have a double accusative in the active, one of the external object, and one of the predicate:—
        <span class="w">táujan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">ƕana þuk silban táujis þu?</span> <span class="gloss">whom makest thou thyself?</span>;
        <span class="w">waúrkjan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">raíhtōs waúrkeiþ stáigōs guþs unsaris</span>, <span class="gloss">make ye straight the paths of our God</span>;
        <span class="w">briggan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">sō sunja frijans izwis briggiþ</span>, <span class="gloss">the truth shall make you free</span>;

        <span class="phr">kunnands ina waír garaíhtana jah weihana</span>, <span class="gloss">knowing him (to be) a just and holy man</span>;
        <span class="w">bigitan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">bigētun þana siukan skalk háilana</span>, <span class="gloss">they found the sick servant whole</span>;
        <span class="w">qiþan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">izwis ni qiþa skalkans</span>, <span class="gloss">I call you not servants</span>;
        <span class="w">namnjan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">þanzei apaústaúluns namnida</span>, <span class="gloss">whom he called apostles</span>;
        <span class="w">rahnjan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">triggwana mik rahnida</span>, <span class="gloss">he counted me faithful</span>;
        <span class="w">háitan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">Daweid ina fráujan háitiþ</span>, <span class="gloss">David calls him Lord</span>;
        <span class="w">áihan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">attan áigum Abraham</span>, <span class="gloss">we have Abraham as father</span>.
      </p>
    

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 427.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Genitive.</span>
        Many verbs govern the direct or indirect object in the genitive, as
        <span class="phr">hilp meináizōs un-galáubeináis</span>, <span class="gloss">help thou my unbelief</span>;
        <span class="phr">fraíhna jah ik izwis áinis waúrdis</span>, <span class="gloss">I will also ask you one word</span>;
        <span class="phr">saei allis skamáip sik meina aíþþáu meináizē waúrdē, þizuh<span class="pb">
<span>184</span></span>sunus mans skamáiþ sik</span>, <span class="gloss">for whosoever shall be ashamed of me or my words, of him shall the son of man be ashamed</span>.
        Other examples are
        <span class="w">brūkjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to use</span>;
        <span class="w">fulljan</span>, <span class="gloss">to fill</span>;
        <span class="w">fullnan</span>, <span class="gloss">to become full</span>;
        <span class="w">gaírnjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to long for</span>;
        <span class="w">ga-hráinjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to make clean</span>;
        <span class="w">ga-þarban</span>, <span class="gloss">to abstain from</span>;
        <span class="w">ga-weisōn</span>, <span class="gloss">to visit</span>;

        <span class="w">þaúrban</span>, <span class="gloss">to need</span>;
        <span class="abbr">&amp;c.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        The <span class="grm">gen.</span> is also governed by certain adjectives, as
        <span class="phr">ahmins weihis fulls</span>, <span class="gloss">full of the Holy Ghost</span>;
        <span class="phr">frija ist þis witōdis</span>, <span class="gloss">she is free from that law</span>;

        <span class="w">waírþs</span>, <span class="gloss">worthy</span>;
        <span class="abbr">&amp;c.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        The <span class="grm">gen.</span> is often used in a partitive sense, especially with <span class="w">ni</span>, <span class="phr">ni waíhts</span>, the interrogative and indefinite pronouns;
        also with the cardinal numerals <span class="w">þūsundi</span>, <span class="w">taíhuntēhund</span>, <span class="phr">twa hunda</span>, <span class="abbr">&amp;c.</span>, and those expressing the decades (<span class="phr">twái tigjus</span>, <span class="abbr">&amp;c.</span>, <span class="ref">§ 247</span>).
        Examples are:
        <span class="phr">jah ni was im barnē</span>, <span class="gloss">they had no child</span>;
        <span class="phr">ni waíht warþigōs</span>, <span class="gloss">nothing of (= no) condemnation</span>;

        <span class="phr">dagē fidwōr tiguns, fráisans fram diabuláu</span>, <span class="gloss">being forty days tempted of the devil</span>.
        A partitive <span class="grm">gen.</span> is also sometimes used with verbs, as
        <span class="phr">insandida skalk ei nēmi akranis</span>, <span class="gloss">he sent a servant that he might receive (some) of the fruit</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 428.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Dative.</span>
        The following verbs and several others take a direct object in the dative case:
        <span class="w">afwaírpan</span>, <span class="gloss">to cast away, put away</span>;
        <span class="w">andhafjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to answer</span>;

        <span class="w">ufarmunnōn</span>, <span class="gloss">to forget</span>.
        The verbs
        <span class="w">fraqistjan</span>, <span class="w">usqistjan</span>, and <span class="w">usqiman</span>, <span class="gloss">to destroy</span>;
        <span class="w">waírpan</span>, <span class="gloss">to cast</span>;
        <span class="w">uswaírpan</span> and <span class="w">usdreiban</span>, <span class="gloss">to cast out</span>, sometimes take the dative and sometimes the accusative without a distinction in meaning.
        A few other verbs take the dative or accusative with a change of meaning, as
        <span class="w">anaháitan</span>, with <span class="grm">dat.</span> <span class="gloss">to scold</span>, with <span class="grm">acc.</span> <span class="gloss">to invoke</span>;

      </p>

      <p>
        Many adjectives take a dative, as
        <span class="w">aglus</span>, <span class="gloss">difficult</span>;
        <span class="w">andaneiþs</span>, <span class="gloss">hostile</span>;

        <span class="w">brūks</span>, <span class="gloss">useful</span>;
        <span class="w">gōþs</span>, <span class="gloss">good</span>;
        <span class="w">hulþs</span>, <span class="gloss">gracious</span>;
        <span class="w">kunþs</span>, <span class="gloss">known</span>;
        <span class="w">liufs</span>,<span class="pb">
<span>186</span></span><span class="gloss">dear</span>;
        <span class="w">mōdags</span>, <span class="gloss">angry</span>;
        <span class="w">raþizō</span>, <span class="gloss">easier</span>;
        <span class="w">skula</span>, <span class="gloss">guilty, liable to</span>;
        <span class="w">skulds</span>, <span class="gloss">owing</span>;
        <span class="w">swērs</span>, <span class="gloss">honoured</span>;
        <span class="w">swikunþs</span>, <span class="gloss">manifest</span>;
        <span class="w">unkunþs</span>, <span class="gloss">unknown</span>;
        <span class="w">wiþrawaírþs</span>, <span class="gloss">opposite</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dative together with <span class="w">wisan</span> or <span class="w">waírþan</span> often has the same meaning as <span class="w">haban</span>, as
        <span class="phr">ni was im barnē</span>, <span class="gloss">they had no children</span>;
        <span class="phr">saúrga mis ist mikila</span>, <span class="gloss">I have great sorrow</span>;
        <span class="phr">waírþiþ þus fahēþs</span>, <span class="gloss">thou shalt have joy</span>;
        <span class="phr">ei uns waírþái þata arbi</span>, <span class="gloss">that we may have the inheritance</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dative is often used reflexively, as
        <span class="phr">leiƕan sis</span>, <span class="gloss">to borrow</span>;
        <span class="phr">rōdida sis áins</span>, <span class="gloss">he spake within himself</span>;
        <span class="phr">ni ōgs þus</span>, <span class="gloss">be (thou) not afraid</span>;
        <span class="phr">ni faúrhteiþ izwis</span>, <span class="gloss">be (ye) not affrighted</span>;
        <span class="phr">frawaúrhta mis</span>, <span class="gloss">I have sinned</span>;
        <span class="phr">þankjan sis or mitōn sis</span>, <span class="gloss">to think to oneself</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dative also discharges the functions of the old ablative, instrumental, and locative, as
        <span class="phr">wōpida Iēsus stibnái mikilái</span>, <span class="gloss">Jesus cried with a loud voice</span>;
        <span class="phr">slōhun is háubiþ ráusa</span>, <span class="gloss">they smote his head with a reed</span>.
        After the comparative where we should use than together with a nominative, as
        <span class="phr">sa afar mis gagganda swinþōza mis ist</span>, <span class="gloss">he that cometh after me is mightier than I</span>;
        <span class="phr">niu sáiwala máis ist fōdeinái jah leik wastjōm</span>, <span class="gloss">is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment</span>;
        <span class="phr">swēgnida ahmin Iēsus</span>, <span class="gloss">Jesus rejoiced in spirit</span>;
        <span class="phr">naht jah daga</span>, <span class="gloss">by night and day</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the dative absolute, see <span class="ref">§ 436</span>.
      </p>
    
  

  
    <h2>Adjectives.</h2>

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 429.</span>
        Adjectives agree with their nouns in number, gender, and case not only when used attributively, but also when the adjective follows the noun, either predicatively or in apposition.
        To this general rule there are a few exceptions.

            (1) An adjective accompanying <span class="w">managei</span>, <span class="gloss">people, multitude</span>, and <span class="w">hiuhma</span>, <span class="gloss">crowd</span>, mostly occurs in the masculine plural, as
            <span class="phr">jah was managei beidandans Zakariins</span>, <span class="gloss">and<span class="pb">
<span>187</span></span>the people waited for Zacharias</span>;
            <span class="phr">jah alls hiuhma was manageins beidandans</span>, <span class="gloss">and the whole crowd of the people was waiting</span> (the Gr. has <span class="w">προσευχόμενον</span>, <span class="gloss">praying</span>).
          </p>
        
        
          <p>
            (2) Grammatical feminines are occasionally treated as masculines, or even when denoting things as neuters and grammatical neuters (when suggesting persons) as masculines, as
            <span class="phr">ei kanniþ wēsi handugei guþs</span>, <span class="gloss">that the wisdom of God might be known</span>;
            <span class="phr">ni waírþiþ garaíhts áinhun leikē</span>, <span class="gloss">no man (<span class="abbr">lit.</span> no one of bodies) becometh just</span>.
          </p>
        
        
          <p>
            (3) When the same adjective refers both to masculine and feminine beings, it is put in the neuter plural, as
            <span class="phr">wēsunuh þan garaíhta ba in and waírþja guþs</span>, <span class="gloss">and they (Zacharias and Elizabeth) were both righteous before God</span>.
          </p>
        
      
    

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 430.</span>
        The strong and weak forms of adjectives are employed in much the same manner as in the other old Germanic languages;
        that is, adjectives used without the definite article follow the strong declension, and those with the definite article follow the weak declension, as
        <span class="phr">was drus is mikils</span>, <span class="gloss">great was the fall of it</span>;
        <span class="phr">ni mag bagms þiuþeigs akrana ubila gatáujan</span>, <span class="gloss">a good tree cannot produce evil fruit</span>;
        <span class="phr">haírdeis sa gōda</span>, <span class="gloss">the good shepherd</span>;
        <span class="phr">untē baúrgs ist þis mikilins þiudanis</span>, <span class="gloss">for it is the city of the great king</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pronominal form of the <span class="grm">nom. acc. neut.</span> of strong adjectives (<span class="ref">§ 226</span>) is never used predicatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        All cardinal numerals, the ordinal numeral <span class="w">anþar</span>, <span class="gloss">second</span>, the possessive pronouns
        <span class="w">meins</span>, <span class="gloss">my</span>;

    <h2>Pronouns.</h2>

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 431.</span>
        The nominative of the personal pronouns is generally omitted, except when the person is to be mentioned with special emphasis.
        When a pronoun stands for two substantives of different genders it is put in the neuter plural, as
        <span class="phr">miþþanei þō wēsun jáinar</span>, <span class="gloss">while they (Joseph and Mary) were there</span>;
        <span class="w">is</span> is sometimes used where we should expect <span class="w">sa</span>, as
        <span class="phr">iþ is dugann mērjan filu … swaswē is ni mahta in baúrg galeiþan</span>, <span class="gloss">but he (the leper) began to publish it widely … so that he (Jesus) could not enter into the city</span>;
        <span class="phr">saei bigitiþ sáiwala seina, fraqisteiþ izái, jah saei fraqisteiþ sáiwalái seinái in meina, bigitiþ þō</span>, <span class="gloss">he that findeth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reflexive pronoun always relates to the subject of its own sentence, as
        <span class="phr">nih Saúlaúmōn in allamma wulþáu seinamma gawasida sik swē áins þizē</span>, <span class="gloss">not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these</span>;
        <span class="phr">swa lagga ƕeila swē miþ sis haband brūþfad, ni magun fastan</span>, <span class="gloss">as long as they [sunjus] have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast</span>;
        <span class="phr">jah [Iēsus] gawaúrhta twalif du wisan miþ sis</span>, <span class="gloss">and [Jesus] appointed twelve to be with him</span>;
        <span class="phr">jah suns ufkunnands Iēsus ahmin seinamma þatei swa þái mitōdēdun sis, qaþ du im</span>, <span class="gloss">and immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The manner in which the possessive pronoun of the third person is expressed has already been stated in <span class="ref">§ 263</span>, examples are:—
        <span class="phr">qiþa izwis þatei haband mizdōn seina</span>, <span class="gloss">I tell you that they have their reward</span>;
        <span class="phr">urrann sa saiands du saian fráiwa seinamma</span>, <span class="gloss">the sower went forth to sow his seed</span>;
        <span class="phr">dáupidái wēsun allái … andháitandans<span class="pb">
<span>189</span></span>frawaúrhtim seináim</span>, <span class="gloss">they were all baptized … confessing their sins</span>;
        <span class="phr">þugkeiþ im áuk ei in filuwaúrdein seinái andháusjáindáu</span>, <span class="gloss">for it seems to them that they will be heard for their much talking</span>.
        On the other hand we have:
        <span class="phr">aflētiþ mannam missadēdins izē</span>, <span class="gloss">ye forgive men their sins</span>;
        <span class="phr">jah [qinō] baþ ina ei þō unhulþōn uswaúrpi us daúhtr izōs</span>, <span class="gloss">and [the woman] begged that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter</span>;
        <span class="phr">jah qimands Iēsus in garda Paítráus gasaƕ swaíhrōn is ligandein jah in heitōm jah attaítōk handáu izōs</span>, <span class="gloss">and Jesus coming into the house of Peter, he saw his mother-in-law lying and in a fever and he touched her hand</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="w">sama</span>, <span class="gloss">same</span>, as substantive and adjective, is used both with and without the article, as
        <span class="phr">niu jah mōtarjōs þata samō táujand?</span> <span class="gloss">do not even the publicans the same?</span>;
        <span class="phr">in þamma samin landa</span>, <span class="gloss">in the same country</span>;
        <span class="phr">ei samō hugjáima jah samō fraþjáima</span>, <span class="gloss">that we may think the same thing and mind the same thing</span>;
        <span class="phr">sijáina þō twa du leika samin</span>, <span class="gloss">they two (man and wife) shall become the same flesh</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="w">silba</span>, <span class="gloss">self</span>, is always either actually or virtually appositional, as
        <span class="phr">silba atta</span>, <span class="gloss">the father himself</span>;
        <span class="phr">ik silba</span>, <span class="gloss">I myself</span>;
        <span class="phr">nasei þuk silban</span>, <span class="gloss">save thyself</span>;
        <span class="phr">ik gabaírhtja imma mik silban</span>, <span class="gloss">I will manifest myself to him</span>;
        <span class="phr">silba faúraqimiþ</span>, <span class="gloss">he himself shall come before</span>.
        The genitive of <span class="w">silba</span> used with possessive pronouns agrees in number and gender with the noun, as
        <span class="phr">þeina silbōns sáiwala þaírhgaggiþ haírus</span>, <span class="gloss">a sword shall pierce thine own soul</span>;
        <span class="phr">waúrstw sein silbins kiusái ƕarjizuh</span>,<span class="gloss"> each man should test his own work</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reciprocal pronoun is expressed by means of the personal pronouns and the adverb <span class="w">missō</span>, <span class="gloss">reciprocally</span>, or by using <span class="w">anþar</span> twice, as
        <span class="phr">ni þanamáis nu uns missō stōjáima</span>, <span class="gloss">let us not therefore judge one another any more</span>;
        <span class="phr">jah qēþun du sis missō</span>, <span class="gloss">and they said one to another</span>;
        <span class="phr">untē sijum anþar anþaris liþus</span>, <span class="gloss">for we are members one of<span class="pb">
<span>190</span></span>another</span>;
        where <span class="w">liþus</span> is in the singular agreeing with <span class="w">anþar</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The antecedent to a relative pronoun is sometimes omitted, the relative may then be either in the case required by the verb of its own clause or in that required by the verb of the principal clause, as
        <span class="phr">ƕa wileiþ ei táujáu þammei</span> (for <span class="phr">þamma þanei</span>) <span class="phr">qiþiþ þiudan Iudaiē?</span> <span class="gloss">what will ye that I do to him whom ye call king of the Jews?</span>;
        <span class="phr">wáit atta izwar þizei</span> (for <span class="phr">þata þizei</span>) <span class="phr">jus þaúrbuþ</span>, <span class="gloss">your father knows of what ye have need</span>.
        Instead of the conjunction <span class="w">þatei</span>, <span class="gloss">that</span>, properly the <span class="grm">nom. acc. sing. neut.</span> of <span class="w">saei</span>, there occurs <span class="w">þammei</span> or <span class="w">þizei</span> when the verb of the principal sentence governs the dative or genitive, as
        <span class="phr">iþ áins þizē, gáumjands þammei hráins warþ</span>, <span class="gloss">but one of them, perceiving that he was cleansed</span>;
        <span class="phr">láisari, niu kara (ist) þuk þizei fraqistnam?</span> <span class="gloss">master, carest thou not that we perish?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        On the genitive governed by the interrogative and indefinite pronouns when used partitively, see <span class="ref">§ 427</span>.

        <span class="section-label">§ 432.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Tenses.</span>
        The future simple is generally expressed by the present, as
        <span class="phr">gasaíƕiþ þana sunu mans</span>, <span class="gloss">ye shall see the son of man</span>;
        <span class="phr">inuh þis bileiþái manna attin seinamma jah áiþein seinái</span>, <span class="gloss">for this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother</span>.
        The future is sometimes also expressed by the present tense forms of

        <span class="w">haban</span>, <span class="gloss">to have</span>;
        <span class="w">duginnan</span>, <span class="gloss">to begin</span>;
        together with an infinitive, as

      </p>

      <p>
        The simple preterite is used in <span class="lang">Gothic</span> where we in <span class="lang">Mod.<span class="pb">
<span>191</span></span>English</span> use either the preterite, perfect, or pluperfect, as
        <span class="phr">jah stibna qam us himinam</span>, <span class="gloss">and there came a voice from heaven</span>;
        <span class="phr">ni jus mik gawalidēduþ, ak ik gawalida izwis</span>, <span class="gloss">ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you</span>;
        <span class="phr">managans áuk gaháilida</span>, <span class="gloss">for he had healed many</span>.
        A present participle along with the preterite of <span class="w">wisan</span>, <span class="gloss">to be</span>, is sometimes used, as in <span class="lang">Mod. English</span>, to express a continuative past tense, as
        <span class="phr">was Iōhannēs dáupjands</span>, <span class="gloss">John was baptizing</span>;
        <span class="phr">wēsun sipōnjōs fastandans</span>, <span class="gloss">the disciples were fasting</span>.

        <span class="section-label">§ 433.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Voices.</span>
        Special forms of the passive voice are extant in the present tense of the indicative and subjunctive only, as
        <span class="w">dáupjada</span>, <span class="gloss">he is baptized</span>;
        <span class="phr">jah þu, barnilō, praúfētus háuhistins háitaza</span>, <span class="gloss">and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest;

        <span class="section-label">§ 434.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Subjunctive.</span>
        The subjunctive is used very often in principal sentences to express a wish or command, as
        <span class="phr">ni briggáis uns in fráistubnjái</span>, <span class="gloss">lead us not into temptation</span>;
        <span class="phr">þaírhgaggáima ju und Bēþlahaím, jah saíƕáima waúrd þata waúrþanō</span>, <span class="gloss">let us go now into Bethlehem, and see this thing (<span class="abbr">lit.</span> word) which is come to pass</span>;

        <span class="phr">wáinei þiudanōdēdeiþ</span>, <span class="gloss">would that ye reigned as kings</span>.
        It is also used in direct dubitative questions, as
        <span class="phr">ƕa qiþáu?</span> <span class="gloss">what shall I say?</span>;
        <span class="phr">ƕáiwa<span class="pb">

        <span class="phr">ƕas þanu sa sijái?</span> <span class="gloss">who then can this be?</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        The most important cases in which the subjunctive is used in subordinate sentences are:—
      </p>

      
        
          <p>
            (1) In indirect or reported commands or entreaties, as

            <span class="phr">wiljáu ei mis gibáis háubiþ Iōhannis</span>, <span class="gloss">I will that thou give me the head of John</span>.
          </p>
        
        
          <p>
            (2) In reported speech when the principal sentence is negative or subjunctive or is a question implying uncertainty, as
            <span class="phr">ni galáubidēdun þatei is blinds wēsi</span>, <span class="gloss">they did not believe that he had been blind</span>;
            <span class="phr">jah jabái qēþjáu þatei ni kunnjáu ina, sijáu galeiks izwis liugnja</span>, <span class="gloss">and if I were to say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like you</span>;

          </p>
        
        
          <p>
            (3) In indirect propositions governed by verbs of hoping, trusting, supposing, and the like, as
            <span class="phr">wēnja ei kunneiþ</span>, <span class="gloss">I hope that ye know</span>;
            <span class="phr">þáiei trauáidēdun sis ei wēseina garaíhtái</span>, <span class="gloss">who trusted in themselves that they were righteous</span>;

          </p>
        
        
          <p>
            (5) In indirect questions, as
            <span class="phr">frēhun ina skuld-u sijái mann qēn afsatjan</span>, <span class="gloss">they asked him whether it was lawful for a man to put away his wife</span>;

          </p>
        
        
          <p>
            (6) In a relative clause attached to an imperative or a subjunctive clause, as

            <span class="phr">saei habái áusōna du háusjan, gaháusjái</span>, <span class="gloss">he that hath ears to hear, let him hear</span>.
            The verb in a relative clause is also in the subjunctive when the principal<span class="pb">
<span>193</span></span>clause is interrogative or negative, as
            <span class="phr">ƕas sa ist saei frawaúrhtins aflētái?</span> <span class="gloss">who is this who forgiveth sins?</span>;
            <span class="phr">nih allis ist ƕa fulginis þatei ni gabaírhtjáidáu</span>, <span class="gloss">for there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested</span>.
          </p>
        
        
          <p>
