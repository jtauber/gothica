  <h1>CHAPTER XVI</h1>
  <h1>SYNTAX</h1>

  
    <h2>Cases.</h2>

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 426.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Accusative.</span>
        Transitive verbs govern the accusative as in other languages:
        <span class="phr">ga-saíƕiþ þana sunu mans</span>, <span class="gloss">ye shall see the son of man</span>;
        <span class="phr">akran baíran</span>, <span class="gloss">to bear fruit</span>;
        &amp;c.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few verbs take an accusative of kindred meaning, as
        <span class="phr">ōhtēdun sis agis mikil</span>, lit. <span class="gloss">they feared great fear for themselves, they feared exceedingly</span>;
        <span class="phr">háifstei þō gōdōn háifst</span>, <span class="gloss">fight (thou) the good fight</span>;
        similarly
        <span class="phr">huzdjan huzda</span>, <span class="gloss">to treasure up treasures</span>;
        <span class="phr">waúrkjan waúrstwa</span>, <span class="gloss">to work works</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        An accusative of closer definition occurs very rarely in Gothic:
        <span class="phr">urrann sa dáuþa gabundans handuns jah fōtuns faskjam</span>, <span class="gloss">the dead man came forth bound as to hands and feet with bandages</span>;
        <span class="phr">standáiþ nu ufgaúdrdanái hupins izwarans sunjái</span>, <span class="gloss">stand therefore, girt as to your loins with truth</span>.
      </p>
      <span class="pb">
<span>183</span></span>
      <p>
        An accusative of the person is used with the impersonal verbs
        <span class="w">grēdōn</span>, <span class="gloss">to be hungry</span>;
        <span class="w">huggrjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to hunger</span>;
        <span class="w">paúrsjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to thirst</span>;
        and also with gen. of the thing
        <span class="phr">kar(a) ist</span>, <span class="gloss">there is a care, it concerns</span>,
        as
        <span class="phr">ni kar-ist ina þizē lambē</span>, <span class="gloss">he careth not for the sheep</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The space and time over which an action extends are expressed by the accusative,
        as
        <span class="phr">qēmun dagis wig</span>, <span class="gloss">they went a day’s journey</span>;
        <span class="phr">jabái ƕas þuk ananáupjái rasta áina, gaggáis miþ imma twōs</span>, <span class="gloss">if anyone (whosoever) shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him two</span>;
        <span class="phr">salida twans dagans</span>, <span class="gloss">he abode two days</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="w">láisjan</span> takes two accusatives, one of the person, and one of the thing taught,
        as
        <span class="phr">láisida ins in gajukōm manag</span>, <span class="gloss">he taught them many a thing in parables</span>.
        The following verbs and a few others have a double accusative in the active, one of the external object, and one of the predicate:—
        <span class="w">táujan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">ƕana þuk silban táujis þu?</span> <span class="gloss">whom makest thou thyself?</span>;
        <span class="w">waúrkjan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">raíhtōs waúrkeiþ stáigōs guþs unsaris</span>, <span class="gloss">make ye straight the paths of our God</span>;
        <span class="w">briggan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">sō sunja frijans izwis briggiþ</span>, <span class="gloss">the truth shall make you free</span>;
        <span class="w">dōmjan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">garaíhtana dōmidēdun guþ</span>, <span class="gloss">they justified God</span>;
        <span class="w">kunnan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">kunnands ina waír garaíhtana jah weihana</span>, <span class="gloss">knowing him (to be) a just and holy man</span>;
        <span class="w">bigitan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">bigētun þana siukan skalk háilana</span>, <span class="gloss">they found the sick servant whole</span>;
        <span class="w">qiþan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">izwis ni qiþa skalkans</span>, <span class="gloss">I call you not servants</span>;
        <span class="w">namnjan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">þanzei apaústaúluns namnida</span>, <span class="gloss">whom he called apostles</span>;
        <span class="w">rahnjan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">triggwana mik rahnida</span>, <span class="gloss">he counted me faithful</span>;
        <span class="w">háitan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">Daweid ina fráujan háitiþ</span>, <span class="gloss">David calls him Lord</span>;
        <span class="w">áihan</span>, as
        <span class="phr">attan áigum Abraham</span>, <span class="gloss">we have Abraham as father</span>.
      </p>
    

    
      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 427.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Genitive.</span>
        Many verbs govern the direct or indirect object in the genitive, as
        <span class="phr">hilp meináizōs un-galáubeináis</span>, <span class="gloss">help thou my unbelief</span>;
        <span class="phr">fraíhna jah ik izwis áinis waúrdis</span>, <span class="gloss">I will also ask you one word</span>;
        <span class="phr">saei allis skamáip sik meina aíþþáu meináizē waúrdē, þizuh<span class="pb">
<span>184</span></span>sunus mans skamáiþ sik</span>, <span class="gloss">for whosoever shall be ashamed of me or my words, of him shall the son of man be ashamed</span>.
        Other examples are
        <span class="w">brūkjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to use</span>;
        <span class="w">fulljan</span>, <span class="gloss">to fill</span>;
        <span class="w">fullnan</span>, <span class="gloss">to become full</span>;
        <span class="w">gaírnjan</span>, <span class="gloss">to long for</span>;

        &amp;c.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gen. is also governed by certain adjectives, as
        <span class="phr">ahmins weihis fulls</span>, <span class="gloss">full of the Holy Ghost</span>;
        <span class="phr">frija ist þis witōdis</span>, <span class="gloss">she is free from that law</span>;

        &amp;c.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gen. is often used in a partitive sense, especially with <span class="w">ni</span>, <span class="phr">ni waíhts</span>, the interrogative and indefinite pronouns;
        also with the cardinal numerals <span class="w">þūsundi</span>, <span class="w">taíhuntēhund</span>, <span class="phr">twa hunda</span>, &amp;c., and those expressing the decades (<span class="phr">twái tigjus</span>, &amp;c., <span class="ref">§ 247</span>).
        Examples are:

      <p>
        <span class="section-label">§ 428.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Dative.</span>

        <span class="w">tēkan</span>, <span class="w">attēkan</span>, <span class="gloss">to touch</span>;
        <span class="w">ufarmunnōn</span>, <span class="gloss">to forget</span>.
        The verbs
        <span class="w">fraqistjan</span>, <span class="w">usqistjan</span>, and <span class="w">usqiman</span>, <span class="gloss">to destroy</span>;
        <span class="w">waírpan</span>, <span class="gloss">to cast</span>;
        <span class="w">uswaírpan</span> and <span class="w">usdreiban</span>, <span class="gloss">to cast out</span>, sometimes take the dative and sometimes the accusative without a distinction in meaning.
        A few other verbs take the dative or accusative with a change of meaning, as
        <span class="w">anaháitan</span>, with dat. <span class="gloss">to scold</span>, with acc. <span class="gloss">to invoke</span>;
        <span class="w">uskiusan</span>, with dat. <span class="gloss">to reject</span>, with acc. <span class="gloss">to prove, test</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many adjectives take a dative, as
        <span class="w">aglus</span>, <span class="gloss">difficult</span>;
        <span class="w">andaneiþs</span>, <span class="gloss">hostile</span>;

        <span class="w">brūks</span>, <span class="gloss">useful</span>;
        <span class="w">gōþs</span>, <span class="gloss">good</span>;
        <span class="w">hulþs</span>, <span class="gloss">gracious</span>;
        <span class="w">kunþs</span>, <span class="gloss">known</span>;
        <span class="w">liufs</span>,<span class="pb">
<span>186</span></span><span class="gloss">dear</span>;
        <span class="w">mōdags</span>, <span class="gloss">angry</span>;
        <span class="w">raþizō</span>, <span class="gloss">easier</span>;

        <span class="w">skulds</span>, <span class="gloss">owing</span>;
        <span class="w">swērs</span>, <span class="gloss">honoured</span>;
        <span class="w">swikunþs</span>, <span class="gloss">manifest</span>;
        <span class="w">unkunþs</span>, <span class="gloss">unknown</span>;
        <span class="w">wiþrawaírþs</span>, <span class="gloss">opposite</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dative together with <span class="w">wisan</span> or <span class="w">waírþan</span> often has the same meaning as <span class="w">haban</span>, as
        <span class="phr">ni was im barnē</span>, <span class="gloss">they had no children</span>;
        <span class="phr">saúrga mis ist mikila</span>, <span class="gloss">I have great sorrow</span>;
        <span class="phr">waírþiþ þus fahēþs</span>, <span class="gloss">thou shalt have joy</span>;
        <span class="phr">ei uns waírþái þata arbi</span>, <span class="gloss">that we may have the inheritance</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dative is often used reflexively, as
        <span class="phr">leiƕan sis</span>, <span class="gloss">to borrow</span>;
        <span class="phr">rōdida sis áins</span>, <span class="gloss">he spake within himself</span>;
        <span class="phr">ni ōgs þus</span>, <span class="gloss">be (thou) not afraid</span>;
        <span class="phr">ni faúrhteiþ izwis</span>, <span class="gloss">be (ye) not affrighted</span>;
        <span class="phr">frawaúrhta mis</span>, <span class="gloss">I have sinned</span>;
        <span class="phr">þankjan sis or mitōn sis</span>, <span class="gloss">to think to oneself</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dative also discharges the functions of the old ablative, instrumental, and locative, as
        <span class="phr">wōpida Iēsus stibnái mikilái</span>, <span class="gloss">Jesus cried with a loud voice</span>;
        <span class="phr">slōhun is háubiþ ráusa</span>, <span class="gloss">they smote his head with a reed</span>.
        After the comparative where we should use than together with a nominative, as
        <span class="phr">sa afar mis gagganda swinþōza mis ist</span>, <span class="gloss">he that cometh after me is mightier than I</span>;
        <span class="phr">niu sáiwala máis ist fōdeinái jah leik wastjōm</span>, <span class="gloss">is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment</span>;
        <span class="phr">swēgnida ahmin Iēsus</span>, <span class="gloss">Jesus rejoiced in spirit</span>;
        <span class="phr">naht jah daga</span>, <span class="gloss">by night and day</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the dative absolute, see <span class="ref">§ 436</span>.
      </p>
    
  

  
    <h2>Adjectives.</h2>

    
      <p class="status-wip">
        <span class="section-label">§ 429.</span>
        Adjectives agree with their nouns in number, gender, and case not only when used attributively, but also when the adjective follows the noun, either predicatively or in apposition.
        To this general rule there are a few exceptions.
      </p>

      
        
          <p class="status-wip">
            (1) An adjective accompanying managei, people, multitude, and hiuhma, crowd, mostly occurs in the masculine plural, as
            jah was managei beidandans Zakariins, and<span class="pb">
<span>187</span></span>the people waited for Zacharias;
            jah alls hiuhma was manageins beidandans, and the whole crowd of the people was waiting (the Gr. has προσευχόμενον, praying).
          </p>

            (2) Grammatical feminines are occasionally treated as masculines, or even when denoting things as neuters and grammatical neuters (when suggesting persons) as masculines, as
            ei kanniþ wēsi handugei guþs, that the wisdom of God might be known;
            ni waírþiþ garaíhts áinhun leikē, no man (lit. no one of bodies) becometh just.

          <p class="status-wip">
            (3) When the same adjective refers both to masculine and feminine beings, it is put in the neuter plural, as wēsunuh þan garaíhta ba in and waírþja guþs, and they (Zacharias and Elizabeth) were both righteous before God.

        The strong and weak forms of adjectives are employed in much the same manner as in the other old Germanic languages;
        that is, adjectives used without the definite article follow the strong declension, and those with the definite article follow the weak declension, as
        was drus is mikils, great was the fall of it;
        ni mag bagms þiuþeigs akrana ubila gatáujan, a good tree cannot produce evil fruit;
        haírdeis sa gōda, the good shepherd;
        untē baúrgs ist þis mikilins þiudanis, for it is the city of the great king.

    <h2>Pronouns.</h2>

    
      <p class="status-wip">
        <span class="section-label">§ 431.</span>
        The nominative of the personal pronouns is generally omitted, except when the person is to be mentioned with special emphasis.
        When a pronoun stands for two substantives of different genders it is put in the neuter plural, as
        miþþanei þō wēsun jáinar, while they (Joseph and Mary) were there;
        is is sometimes used where we should expect sa, as
        iþ is dugann mērjan filu … swaswē is ni mahta in baúrg galeiþan, but he (the leper) began to publish it widely … so that he (Jesus) could not enter into the city;
        saei bigitiþ sáiwala seina, fraqisteiþ izái, jah saei fraqisteiþ sáiwalái seinái in meina, bigitiþ þō, he that findeth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
      </p>

      <p class="status-wip">
        The reflexive pronoun always relates to the subject of its own sentence, as
        nih Saúlaúmōn in allamma wulþáu seinamma gawasida sik swē áins þizē, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these;
        swa lagga ƕeila swē miþ sis haband brūþfad, ni magun fastan, as long as they [sunjus] have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast;
        jah [Iēsus] gawaúrhta twalif du wisan miþ sis, and [Jesus] appointed twelve to be with him;
        jah suns ufkunnands Iēsus ahmin seinamma þatei swa þái mitōdēdun sis, qaþ du im, and immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them.
      </p>

      <p class="status-wip">
        The manner in which the possessive pronoun of the third person is expressed has already been stated in § 263, examples are:—qiþa izwis þatei haband mizdōn seina, I tell you that they have their reward;
        urrann sa saiands du saian fráiwa seinamma, the sower went forth to sow his seed;
        dáupidái wēsun allái … andháitandans<span class="pb">
<span>189</span></span>frawaúrhtim seináim, they were all baptized … confessing their sins;
        þugkeiþ im áuk ei in filuwaúrdein seinái andháusjáindáu, for it seems to them that they will be heard for their much talking.
        On the other hand we have:
        aflētiþ mannam missadēdins izē, ye forgive men their sins;
        jah [qinō] baþ ina ei þō unhulþōn uswaúrpi us daúhtr izōs, and [the woman] begged that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter;
        jah qimands Iēsus in garda Paítráus gasaƕ swaíhrōn is ligandein jah in heitōm jah attaítōk handáu izōs, and Jesus coming into the house of Peter, he saw his mother-in-law lying and in a fever and he touched her hand.
      </p>

      <p class="status-wip">
        sama, same, as substantive and adjective, is used both with and without the article, as
        niu jah mōtarjōs þata samō táujand? do not even the publicans the same?;
        in þamma samin landa, in the same country;
        ei samō hugjáima jah samō fraþjáima, that we may think the same thing and mind the same thing;
        sijáina þō twa du leika samin, they two (man and wife) shall become the same flesh.
      </p>

      <p class="status-wip">
        silba, self, is always either actually or virtually appositional, as
        silba atta, the father himself;
        ik silba, I myself;
        nasei þuk silban, save thyself;
        ik gabaírhtja imma mik silban, I will manifest myself to him;
        silba faúraqimiþ, he himself shall come before.
        The genitive of silba used with possessive pronouns agrees in number and gender with the noun, as
        þeina silbōns sáiwala þaírhgaggiþ haírus, a sword shall pierce thine own soul;
        waúrstw sein silbins kiusái ƕarjizuh, each man should test his own work.
      </p>

      <p class="status-wip">
        The reciprocal pronoun is expressed by means of the personal pronouns and the adverb missō, reciprocally, or by using anþar twice, as
        ni þanamáis nu uns missō stōjáima, let us not therefore judge one another any more;
        jah qēþun du sis missō, and they said one to another;
        untē sijum anþar anþaris liþus, for we are members one of<span class="pb">
<span>190</span></span>another;
        where liþus is in the singular agreeing with anþar.
      </p>

      <p class="status-wip">
        The antecedent to a relative pronoun is sometimes omitted, the relative may then be either in the case required by the verb of its own clause or in that required by the verb of the principal clause, as
        ƕa wileiþ ei táujáu þammei (for þamma þanei) qiþiþ þiudan Iudaiē? what will ye that I do to him whom ye call king of the Jews?;
        wáit atta izwar þizei (for þata þizei) jus þaúrbuþ, your father knows of what ye have need.
        Instead of the conjunction þatei, that, properly the nom. acc. sing. neut. of saei, there occurs þammei or þizei when the verb of the principal sentence governs the dative or genitive, as
        iþ áins þizē, gáumjands þammei hráins warþ, but one of them, perceiving that he was cleansed;
        láisari, niu kara (ist) þuk þizei fraqistnam? master, carest thou not that we perish?
      </p>

      <p class="status-wip">

        The future simple is generally expressed by the present, as
        gasaíƕiþ þana sunu mans, ye shall see the son of man;
        inuh þis bileiþái manna attin seinamma jah áiþein seinái, for this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother.
        The future is sometimes also expressed by the present tense forms of
        skulan, shall;
        haban, to have;
        duginnan, to begin;
        together with an infinitive, as
        saei skal stōjan qiwans jah dáuþans, who shall judge the quick and the dead;
        þarei ik im, þaruh sa andbahts meins wisan habáiþ, where I am, there shall also my servant be;
        gáunōn jah grētan duginniþ, ye shall mourn and weep.

      <p class="status-wip">
        The simple preterite is used in Gothic where we in Mod.<span class="pb">
<span>191</span></span>English use either the preterite, perfect, or pluperfect, as
        jah stibna qam us himinam, and there came a voice from heaven;
        ni jus mik gawalidēduþ, ak ik gawalida izwis, ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you;
        managans áuk gaháilida, for he had healed many.
        A present participle along with the preterite of wisan, to be, is sometimes used, as in Mod. English, to express a continuative past tense, as
        was Iōhannēs dáupjands, John was baptizing;
        wēsun sipōnjōs fastandans, the disciples were fasting.

        <span class="section-label">§ 433.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Voices.</span>
        Special forms of the passive voice are extant in the present tense of the indicative and subjunctive only, as
        dáupjada, he is baptized;
        jah þu, barnilō, praúfētus háuhistins háitaza, and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest;
        aflētanda þus frawaúrhteis þeinōs, thy sins are forgiven thee;
        ei andhuljáindáu us managáim haírtam mitōneis, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
        The other forms of the passive voice are expressed by the past participle and one of the auxiliary verbs
        wisan, to be;
        waírþan, to become;
        as
        gamēliþ ist, it is written;

        <span class="section-label">§ 434.</span>
        <span class="section-label">Subjunctive.</span>
        The subjunctive is used very often in principal sentences to express a wish or command, as
        ni briggáis uns in fráistubnjái, lead us not into temptation;
        þaírhgaggáima ju und Bēþlahaím, jah saíƕáima waúrd þata waúrþanō, let us go now into Bethlehem, and see this thing (lit. word) which is come to pass;
        ak háitadáu Iōhannēs, but he shall be called John;
        wáinei þiudanōdēdeiþ, would that ye reigned as kings.
        It is also used in direct dubitative questions, as
        ƕa qiþáu? what shall I say?;
        ƕáiwa<span class="pb">
<span>192</span></span>meináim waúrdam galáubjáiþ? how shall ye believe my words?;
        ƕas þanu sa sijái? who then can this be?

      <p class="status-wip">
        The most important cases in which the subjunctive is used in subordinate sentences are:—
      </p>

      
        
          <p class="status-wip">
            (1) In indirect or reported commands or entreaties, as
            anabáuþ im ei mann ni qēþeina, he commanded them that they should not tell any man;
            wiljáu ei mis gibáis háubiþ Iōhannis, I will that thou give me the head of John.
          </p>
        
        
          <p class="status-wip">
            (2) In reported speech when the principal sentence is negative or subjunctive or is a question implying uncertainty, as
            ni galáubidēdun þatei is blinds wēsi, they did not believe that he had been blind;
            jah jabái qēþjáu þatei ni kunnjáu ina, sijáu galeiks izwis liugnja, and if I were to say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like you;
            ƕa wileis ei táujá þus? what wilt thou that I do for thee?

          <p class="status-wip">
            (3) In indirect propositions governed by verbs of hoping, trusting, supposing, and the like, as
            wēnja ei kunneiþ, I hope that ye know;
            þáiei trauáidēdun sis ei wēseina garaíhtái, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous;
            jáinái hugidēdun þatei is bi slēp qēþi, they supposed that he was speaking about sleep.

          <p class="status-wip">
            (4) In statements reported at second hand, as
            weis háusidēdum ana witōda þatei Xristus sijái du áiwa, we have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever.
          </p>
        
        
          <p class="status-wip">
            (5) In indirect questions, as
            frēhun ina skuld-u sijái mann qēn afsatjan, they asked him whether it was lawful for a man to put away his wife;
            ni wissa ƕa rōdidēdi, he knew not what he should say;
            ni haband ƕa matjáina, they have nothing to eat.

          <p class="status-wip">
            (6) In a relative clause attached to an imperative or a subjunctive clause, as

            saei habái áusōna du háusjan, gaháusjái, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
            The verb in a relative clause is also in the subjunctive when the principal<span class="pb">
<span>193</span></span>clause is interrogative or negative, as
            ƕas sa ist saei frawaúrhtins aflētái? who is this who forgiveth sins?;
            nih allis ist ƕa fulginis þatei ni gabaírhtjáidáu, for there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested.

          <p class="status-wip">
            (7) In conditional clauses implying hypothesis or uncertainty, as

            nih qēmjáu jah rōdidēdjáu du im, frawaúrht ni habáidēdeina, if I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin.

          <p class="status-wip">
            (8) Frequently in adverbial clauses which express a reason, as
            ni manna giutiþ wein juggata in balgins faírnjans, ibái áuftō distaírái wein þata niujō þans balgins, no man poureth new wine into old bottles, lest perchance the new wine burst the bottles.

          <p class="status-wip">
            (9) To express purpose, as
            attaúhun þata barn, ei tawidēdeina bi biūhtja witōdis, they brought the child that they might do according to the custom of the law;
            frawardjand andwaírþja seina, ei gasaíƕáindáu mannam fastandans, they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.

          <p class="status-wip">
            (10) The temporal conjunction faúrþizei is always followed by the subjunctive, as

        <span class="section-label">Infinitive.</span>
        The infinitive or a clause containing an infinitive is often used as the subject or object of a finite verb.
        
          
            (1) As subject:—ni gōþ ist niman hláif barnē jah waírpan hundam, it is not good to take the children’s bread and to cast it to dogs;
            warþ afsláuþnan allans, it came to pass that they were all amazed;
            warþ þaírhgaggan imma þaírh atisk, it came to pass that he went through the cornfields.
          
          
            (2) As object:—ōhtēdun fraíhnan ina, they feared to ask him;

            qiþand usstass ni wisan, they say that there is not any resurrection.

            skal sunus mans uskusans waírþan, the son of man shall be rejected.
          
          
            (2) Not unfrequently by the active infinitive, as
            qēmun þan mōtarjōs dáupjan, then came the publicans to be baptized;
            qēmun háiljan sik saúhtē seináizō, they came to be healed of their infirmities.
          
          
            (3) Occasionally by mahts wisan, skuld wisan, along with an active infinitive, as
            maht wēsi frabugjan, it might have been sold (lit. it were possible to sell);
            ƕáiwa þu qiþis, þatei skulds ist usháuhjan sa sunus mans? how sayest thou, that the son of man must be lifted up?

        The past participle of intransitive verbs has an active meaning, as
        in garda qumans, being in the house;
        ƕa wēsi þata waúrþanō, what it was that had come to pass;
        and similarly with the pp. of diwan, to die;
