  <head>PROPER NAMES</head>
  <p>
    The <lang>Gothic</lang> spelling and pronunciation of <lang>Greek</lang> proper names, and of loan-words generally, were intentionally excluded from the chapter on <lang>Gothic</lang> pronunciation, in order that what was necessary to be said on these points might be reserved for the Glossary of proper names. The following few remarks, which are mostly confined to the vowels in proper names, will be useful to the learner:—
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>α</c> is regularly represented by <c>a</c>, as
    <w>Ἀβιάθαρ</w>, <w>Abiaþar</w>;
    <w>Ἄννα</w>, <w>Anna</w>;
    <w>Βηθσφαγή</w>, <w>Bēþsfagei</w>;
    <w>Δημᾶς</w>, <w>Dēmas</w>;
    <w>Θωμᾶς</w>, <w>þōmas</w>;
    <w>Ἰσαάκ</w>, <w>Isak</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>ε</c> is regularly represented by <c>aí</c>, as
    <w>Ἔφεσος</w>, <w>Aífaísō</w>;
    <w>λεγεών</w>, <w>Laígaíōn</w>;
    <w>Πέτρος</w>, <w>Paítrus</w>;
    <w>Βεελζεβούλ</w>, <w>Baíaílzaíbul</w>;
    but <w>Βηθλεέμ</w>, <w>Bēþlahaím</w>.
    Cp. <ref>§ 10</ref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>ι</c> is represented by <c>i</c> or <c>ei</c>. No fixed rule can be laid down as to when it is represented by the one and when by the other. Examples of the former are:—
    <w>Δεκάπολις</w>, <w>Daíkapaúlis</w>;
    <w>φιλητός</w>, <w>Filētus</w>;
    <w>Ἰδουμαία</w>, <w>Idumaia</w>;
    <w>Συρία</w>, <w>Syria</w>;
    <w>Ἰακώβ</w>, <w>Iakōb</w>;
    <w>Ἰησοῦς</w>, <w>Iēsus</w>;
    <w>Ἰωσήφ</w>, <w>Iōsēf</w>;
    and of the latter:—
    <w>Ἰκόνιον</w>, <w>Eikaúniō</w>;
    <w>Γαλιλαία</w>, <w>Galeilaia</w>;
    <w>Τιμόθεος</w>, <w>Teimaúpaíus</w>;
    <w>Σιδών</w>, <w>Seidōn</w>;
    <w>Σίμων</w>, <w>Seimōn</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <c>ι</c> is represented by <c>aí</c> in <w>Kyreinaíus</w>, <w>Κυρήνιος</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <c>ι</c> is sometimes represented by <c>j</c> before a following vowel, as
    <w>Ἰάειρος</w>, <w>Jaeirus</w>;
    <w>Ἰαννῆς</w>, <w>Janēs</w>;
    <w>Μαρία</w>, <w>Marja</w>, beside <w>Maria</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>ο</c> is regularly represented by <c>aú</c> in other than final syllables, as
    <w>Ὀνησιφόρος</w>, <w>Aúneiseifaúrus</w>;
    <w>Βοανεργές</w>, <w>Baúanaírgaís</w>;
    <w>Ἰόρδανος</w>, <w>Iaúrdanus</w>;
    <w>Σολομών</w>, <w>Saúlaúmōn</w>.
    Cp. the beginning of <ref>§ 11</ref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In final syllables it is regularly represented by <c>u</c>, as<pb n="360"/>
    <w>Αὔγουστος</w>, <w>Agustus</w>;
    <w>Μάρκος</w>, <w>Markus</w>;
    <w>φίλιππος</w>, <w>Filippus</w>;
    <w>Πέτρος</w>, <w>Paítrus</w>.
    These and similar words are declined like <w>sunus</w> (<ref>§ 202</ref>) in the singular, but are mostly declined like i-stems (<ref>§§ 196, 198</ref>) in the plural.
  </p>
  <p>
    <c>ο</c> is represented by <c>ō</c> in <w>Aírmōgaínēs</w>, <w>Ἐρμογένης</w>. The <c>u</c> instead of <c>aú</c> in <w>Iaírusaúlyma</w>, <w>Ἱεροσόλυμα</w> is due to the influence of the <c>u</c> in <w>Iaírusalēm</w>, <w>Ἱερουσαλήμ</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>υ</c> is regularly represented by <c>𐍅</c> in the <lang>Gothic</lang> alphabet, so that forms like <w>φύγελος</w>, <w>Συρία</w> ought properly to be transcribed by <w>Fwgaílus</w>, <w>Swria</w>, <abbr>cp.</abbr> <c>αυ</c>, <c>ευ</c> below. It has however become usual in all grammars, glossaries, and editions of the <lang>Gothic</lang> text, to transcribe <lang>Greek</lang> <c>υ</c> in the function of a vowel by <c>y</c>. Inaccurate as this mode of transcription is, I have thought it advisable to adopt the usual transcription throughout this book. Examples are:—
    <w>Τυχικός</w>, <w>Tykeikus</w>;
    <w>Ἱεροσόλυμα</w>, <w>Iaírusaúlyma</w>;
    <w>Ὑμέναιος</w>, <w>Ymaínaius</w>;
    <w>Συμεών</w>, <w>Symaíōn</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <c>υ</c> is represented by <c>aú</c> in <w>Saúr</w>, <w>Σύρος</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>η</c> is mostly represented by <c>ē</c>, as <w>Ἀσήρ</w>, <w>Asēr</w>; <w>Δημᾶς</w>, <w>Dēmas</w>; <w>φανουήλ</w>, <w>Fanuēl</w>; <w>Ἰησοῦς</w>, <w>Iēsus</w>. It is also sometimes represented by <c>ei</c> (<abbr>cp.</abbr> <ref>§ 5</ref>), as <w>Ὀνησιφόρος</w>, <w>Aúnei-seifaúrus</w>; <w>Κυρήνιος</w>, <w>Kyreinaíus</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <c>η</c> is represented by <c>ai</c> in <w>Gaírgaísainus</w>, <w>Γεργεσηνός</w>. And beside the regular form <w>Bēþania</w>, <w>Βηθανία</w>, we have the <grm>dat.</grm> form <w>Biþaniin</w> (<cite>Mark xi. 1</cite>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>ω</c> is usually represented by <c>ō</c>, as
    <w>Ἰακώβ</w>, <w>Iakōb</w>;
    <w>Ἰωσήφ</w>, <w>Iōsēf</w>;
    <w>Μωσῆς</w>, <w>Mosēs</w>;
    <w>Θωμᾶς</w>, <w>Ϸōmas</w>;
    <w>Σολομών</w>, <w>Saúlaúmōn</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is represented by <c>au</c> in <w>Lauidja</w>, <w>Λωΐς</w>; <w>Trauada</w>, <w>Τρῳάς</w>; <abbr>cp.</abbr> the end of <ref>§ 11</ref>. And by <c>ū</c> in <w>Rūma</w>, <lang>Lat.</lang> <w>Rōma</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>αι</c>, which was a long open <c>e</c>-sound like the <c>ǣ</c> in <lang>OE.</lang> <w>slǣpan</w>, is regularly represented by <c>ai</c>, as
    <w>Ἀλφαῖος</w>, <w>Alfaius</w>;
    <w>Ναιμάν</w>, <w>Naiman</w>;
    <w>Ἰδουμαία</w>, <w>Idumaia</w>;
    <w>Φαρισαῖος</w>, <w>Fareisaius</w>;
    <abbr>cp.</abbr> the close of <ref>§ 10</ref>.
  </p>
  <pb n="361"/>
  <p>
    <c>αϊ</c> is represented by <c>aei</c>, as
    <w>Βηθσαϊδά</w>, <w>Bēþsaeida</w>;
    <w>Ἠσαΐας</w>, <w>Ēsaeias</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>ει</c>, which was a long <c>i</c>-sound, is regularly represented by <c>ei</c> (<ref>§ 3</ref>), as
    <w>Δαυείδ</w>, <w>Daweid</w>;
    <w>Ἰάειρος</w>, <w>Jaeirus</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>αυ</c> is represented by <c>aw</c>, as
    <w>Δαυείδ</w>, <w>Daweid</w>;
    <w>Παῦλος</w>, <w>Pawlus</w>.
    <w>Agustáu</w> (<cite>Luke ii. 1</cite>) is probably a mistake for <w>Awgustáu</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>ευ</c> is represented by <c>aíw</c>, as
    <w>Εὐνίκη</w>, <w>Aíwneika</w>;
    <w>Λευΐς</w>, <w>Laíwweis</w>;
    <w>εὐαγγέλιον</w>, <w>aíwaggēljō</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>ου</c>, which was a long close <c>u</c>-sound, is regularly represented by <c>u</c>, as
    <w>Αὔγουστος</w>, <w>Agustus</w>;
    <w>Φανουήλ</w>, <w>Fanuēl</w>;
    <w>Ἰδουμαία</w>, <w>Idumaia</w>;
    <w>Ἰησοῦς</w>, <w>Iēsus</w>;
    <w>Ἰούδας</w>, <w>Iudas</w>;
    <w>Καφαρναούμ</w>, <w>Kafarnaum</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <lang>Gothic</lang> representation of the <lang>Greek</lang> consonants in proper names requires but little comment. The <lang>Greek</lang> consonants are generally represented by the corresponding <lang>Gothic</lang> equivalents, that is <c>β</c>, <c>γ</c>, <c>δ</c>, <c>ζ</c>, <c>θ</c>, <c>κ</c>, <c>λ</c>, <c>μ</c>, <c>ν</c>, <c>ξ</c>, <c>π</c>, <c>ρ</c>, <c>σ</c> (<c>ς</c>), <c>τ</c>, <c>φ</c>, <c>ψ</c> are almost in every case regularly represented by <c>b</c>, <c>g</c>, <c>d</c>, <c>z</c>, <c>þ</c>, <c>k</c>, <c>l</c>, <c>m</c>, <c>n</c>, <c>ks</c>, <c>p</c>, <c>r</c>, <c>s</c>, <c>t</c>, <c>f</c>, <c>ps</c> respectively. For examples see the Glossary below. The following points require to be noticed:—
  </p>
  <p>
    The <lang>Greek</lang> spiritus asper is generally represented by <c>h</c>, as
    <w>Ἑλισαῖος</w>, <w>Haíleisaius</w>;
    <w>Ἡλίας</w>, <w>Hēlias</w>;
    <w>Ἡρωδιανός</w>, <w>Hērōdianus</w>;
    it is however also occasionally omitted, as in <w>Ἱερουσαλήμ</w>, <w>Iaírusalēm</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <c>h</c> has sometimes been inserted in the <lang>Gothic</lang> form between two vowels, as
    <w>Ἀβραάμ</w>, <w>Abraham</w>;
    <w>Βηθλεέμ</w>, <w>Bēþlahaím</w>;
    <w>Ἰωάννης</w>, <w>Iōhannēs</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <lang>Greek</lang> <c>τ</c> we have <c>þ</c> in
    <w>Nazareiþ</w>, <w>Ναζαρέτ</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <lang>Greek</lang> <c>χ</c> is represented by <c>X</c> in
    <w>Xristus</w>, <w>Χριστός</w>;
    but it is generally represented by <c>k</c>, as
    <w>Antiaúkia</w>, <w>Ἀντιοχία</w>;
    <w>Tykeikus</w>, <w>Τυχικός</w>.
    On the other hand <lang>Greek</lang> <c>κ</c> is represented by <c>X</c> in
    <w>Xrēskus</w>, <w>Κρήσκης</w>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inflected forms of <lang>Greek</lang> proper names in <lang>Gothic</lang> are given in the Glossary below, so far as they occur in<pb n="362"/>the specimens which I have chosen. No hard and fast rule for the inflection of these words can be given, as they sometimes preserve the <lang>Greek</lang> endings, sometimes have <lang>Gothic</lang> endings, and sometimes have a mixture of the two. Most consistency prevails in nouns ending in the <grm>nom.</grm> in <m>-us</m>, <lang>Greek</lang> <m>-ος</m>; these usually follow the u-declension in the <grm>sing.</grm>, but the i-declension in the <grm>plural</grm>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout the grammar I have followed the usual practice of regarding each of the digraphs <c>ai</c>, <c>au</c> (printed <c>ái</c>, <c>aí</c>, <c>ai</c>; <c>áu</c>, <c>aú</c>, <c>au</c> in this book) as representing three different sounds, see <ref>§§ 10, 67, 69, 76, 83</ref>; and <ref>§§ 11, 71, 73, 80, 84</ref>. Some scholars go so far as to assume that the Germanic diphthongs <c>ai</c>, <c>au</c> remained in <lang>Gothic</lang> in accented syllables, but became respectively long open <c>ǣ</c> and long open <c>ǭ</c> in other positions. It is not, however, improbable that the two diphthongs had become monophthongs in all positions at the time Ulfilas lived, just as e. g. <c>αι</c> had become a monophthong in <lang>Greek</lang> at a much earlier period, although the <c>αι</c> was retained in writing. It seems almost incredible that a man like Ulfilas, who showed such great skill in other respects, should have used <c>ai</c> for a short open <c>e</c>, a long open <c>ǣ</c> and a diphthong; and <c>au</c> for a short open <c>o</c>, a long open <c>ǭ</c> and a diphthong. Whereas, if we assume that the diphthongs had become monophthongs (<c>ǣ</c>, <c>ǭ</c>), there is nothing incongruous in his having used each of the digraphs to represent two sounds which only differed in quantity but not in quality. This will also account for the fact that he regularly transcribed <lang>Greek</lang> <c>αι</c> by <c>ai</c>, and <c>αυ</c> by <c>aw</c>, because in the former case the diphthong had become a monophthong, and in the latter case the second element of the original <lang>Greek</lang> diphthong had become a spirant which at a later period was pronounced <c>v</c> before voiced and <c>f</c> before voiceless sounds.
