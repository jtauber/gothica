            A few of the chief characteristics of the Germanic languages as compared with the other branches of the Indo-Germanic languages are:
            the first sound-shifting or Grimm’s law (<ref>§§ 127–32</ref>);
            Verner’s law (<ref>§§ 136–7</ref>);
            the development of the so-called weak declension of adjectives (<ref>§ 223</ref>);
            the development of the preterite of weak verbs (<ref>§ 315</ref>);
            the use of the old perfect as a preterite (<ref>§ 292</ref>).
