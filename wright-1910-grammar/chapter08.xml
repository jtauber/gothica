  <head>THE FIRST SOUND-SHIFTING, VERNER’S LAW, AND OTHER CONSONANT CHANGES WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE PRIMITIVE GERMANIC LANGUAGE</head>

      § 126. The first sound-shifting, popularly called Grimm’s Law, refers to the changes which the Indo-Germanic explosives underwent in the period of the Germanic primitive community, i. e. before the Germanic parent language became differentiated into the separate Germanic languages:—Gothic, O. Norse, O. English, O. Frisian, O. Saxon (= O. Low German), O. Low Franconian (O. Dutch), and O. High German.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Indo-Germanic parent language had the following system of consonants:—

            Note.—1. Explosives are consonants which are formed with complete closure of the mouth passage, and may be pronounced with or without voice, i. e. with or without the vocal cords being set in action; in the former case they are said to be voiced (e.g. the mediae), and in the latter voiceless (e.g. the tenues). The aspirates are pronounced like the simple tenues and mediae followed by an h, like the Anglo-Irish pronunciation of t in tell.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The palatal explosives are formed by the front or middle of<pb n="51"/>the tongue and the roof of the mouth (hard palate), like g, k (c) in English get, good, kid, could; whereas the velars are formed by the root of the tongue and the soft palate (velum). The latter do not occur in English, but are common in Hebrew, and are often heard in the Swiss pronunciation of German. In the parent Indo-Germanic language there were two kinds of velars, viz. pure velars and velars with lip rounding. The pure velars fell together with the Indg. palatals in Germanic, Latin, Greek, and Keltic, but were kept apart in the Aryan and Baltic-Slavonic languages. The velars with lip rounding appear in the Germanic languages partly with and partly without labialization, see § 134. The palatal and velar nasals only occurred before their corresponding explosives, ńk, ńg; ŋq, ŋɡ, &amp;c.
          </p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
            2. Spirants are consonants formed by the mouth passage being narrowed at one spot in such a manner that the outgoing breath gives rise to a frictional sound at the narrowed part.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            z only occurred before voiced explosives, e. g. *nizdos = Lat. nīdus, English nest; *ozdos = Gr. ὄζος, Goth. asts, bough.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            j was like the widely spread North German pronunciation of j in ja, not exactly like the y in English yes, which is generally pronounced without distinct friction. j occurred very rarely in the prim. Indo-Germanic language. In the Germanic, as in most other Indo-Germanic languages, the frictional element in this sound became reduced, which caused it to pass into the so-called semivowel.
          </p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
            3. The nasals and liquids had the functions both of vowels and consonants (§ 35).

        </item>
        <item>
          <p>
            4. The essential difference between the so-called semivowels and full vowels is that the latter always bear the stress (accent) of the syllable in which they occur, e. g. in English ców, stáin the first element of the diphthong is a vowel, the second a consonant; but in words like French rwá (written roi), bjḗr (written bière), the first element of the diphthong is a consonant, the second a vowel. In consequence of this twofold function, a diphthong may be defined as the combination of a sonantal with a consonantal vowel. And it is called a falling or rising diphthong according as the stress is upon the first or second element. In this book the second element of diphthongs<pb n="52"/>is written i, u when the first element is the bearer of the stress, thus ái, áu, &amp;c., but when the second element has the stress the first element is written j, w, thus já, wá, &amp;c.

            5. In the writing down of prim. Germanic forms the signs þ (= th in Engl. thin), đ (= th in Engl. then), Ҍ (= a bilabial spirant, which may be pronounced like the v in Engl. vine), ʒ (= g often heard in German sagen), χ (= NHG. ch and the ch in Scotch loch).

      § 127. In the following tables of the normal equivalents of the Indg. explosives in Latin, Greek, and the Germanic languages, Table I contains the Indg. tenues p, t, k, the mediae b, d, g and the pure velars q, g. Table II contains the Indg. mediae aspiratae and the velars q, g with labialization. The equivalents in the Germanic languages do not contain the changes caused by Verner’s Law, &amp;c. The East Franconian dialect is taken as the normal for OHG.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following points should be noticed:—
    </p>

    <list>
      <item>
        <p>
          (1) The Indg. tenues p, t, k and the mediae b, d, g generally remained unchanged in Latin and Greek.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          (2) The pure velars (q, g) fell together with the palatals k, g in Latin and Greek. They became χ, k in prim. Germanic, and thus fell together with the χ, k from Indg. k, g.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          (3) The pure velar gh fell together with the original palatal gh in Latin and Greek.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          (4) The Indg. mediae aspiratae became in prehistoric Latin and Greek tenues aspiratae, and thus fell together with the original tenues aspiratae.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          (5) The Indg. tenues aspiratae became voiceless spirants in prim. Germanic, and thus fell together with the voiceless spirants from the Indg. tenues. See § 130.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          (6) In Latin Indg. q with labialization became qu, rarely c. g with labialization became v (but gu after n, and g when the labialized element had been lost, as gravis = Gr. βαρύς, heavy).
        </p>
        <pb n="53"/>
        <p>
          Indg. ph, bh became f initially and b medially.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indg. th, dh became f initially, b medially before and after r, before l and after u (w), in other cases d.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indg. kh, gh became h initially before and medially between vowels; g before and after consonants, and f before u (w).
        </p>
        <p>
          Indg. qh, ɡh with labialization became f initially, v medially except that after n they became gu.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          (7) In Greek Indg. q, ɡ with labialization became π, β before non-palatal vowels (except u) and before consonants (except Indg. j); τ, δ before palatal vowels; and κ, γ before and after u.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indg. ph, bh became φ; th, dh became θ; and kh, gh became χ.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indg. qh, ɡh with labialization became φ before non-palatal vowels (except u) and before consonants (except Indg. j); θ before palatal vowels; and χ before and after u.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
          (8) When two consecutive syllables would begin with aspirates, the first was de-aspirated in prehistoric times in Sanskrit and Greek, as Skr. bándhanam, a binding, Goth. OE. bindan, OHG. bintan, to bind; Skr. bṓdhati, he learns, is awake, Gr. πεύθεται, he asks, inquires, Goth. anabiudan, OE. bēodan, to bid, OHG. biotan, to offer, root bheudh-; Gr. κανθύλη, a swelling, OE. gund, OHG. gunt, matter, pus; Gr. θρίξ, hair, gen. τριχός; ἔχω, I have, fut. ἕξω.
        </p>
      </item>
      <item>
        (9) In OHG. the prim. Germanic explosives p, t became the affricatae pf, tz (generally written zz, z), initially, as also medially after consonants, and when doubled. But prim. Germanic p, t, k became the double spirants ff, ȥȥ, hh (also written ch) medially between vowels and finally after vowels. The double spirants were simplified to f, z, h when they became final or came to stand before other consonants, and also generally medially when preceded by a long vowel or diphthong.

      § 133. ƀ, đ, ʒ remained in other positions, and their further development belongs to the history of the separate Germanic languages. In Goth. ƀ, đ (written b, d) remained medially after vowels, but became explosives (b, d) after consonants. They became f, ϸ finally after vowels and before final -s. ʒ remained medially between vowels, and medially after vowels before voiced consonants, but became χ (written g) finally after vowels and before final -s. It became g initially, and also medially after voiced consonants. See §§ 166–9. In O.Icel. ƀ (written f) remained medially between and finally after voiced sounds, but became f before voiceless sounds. đ (written ð) generally remained medially and finally. ʒ remained medially after vowels and liquids, but became χ and then disappeared finally. It became g initially. đ became d in all the West Germanic languages and then d became t in OHG. In OE. ƀ (generally written f) remained between voiced sounds, but became voiceless f finally. ʒ remained in the oldest period of the language. In OS. ƀ (written ƀ, b) generally remained between voiced sounds. It became f medially before 1 and n, and before voiceless consonants, and also finally. ʒ (written g) remained initially and medially, but became χ finally, although it was generally written g. In OHG. ƀ, ʒ became b, g. Geminated ƀƀ, đđ, ʒʒ, of whatever origin, became bb, dd, gg in the prehistoric period of all the Germanic languages.

      § 134. From the examples given in §§ 128–33, it will be seen that the Germanic sounds, which arose from the Indg. velars, appear partly with and partly without labialization. In the latter case they fell together with prim. Germ. χ, k, ʒ from Indg. k, g, gh, cp. e. g. Goth. hafjan (q), kalds (g), gasts (gh), beside Goth. hund (k), kniu (g), guma (gh). The conditions for this twofold development of the Indg. velars in the Germanic languages have not yet been definitely ascertained for all cases. It is, however, now pretty certain that the parent Indg. language contained two series of velars: (1) Pure velars which never had labialization. These velars fell together with the palatals in the Germanic, Greek, Latin, and Keltic languages, but were kept apart in the Aryan and Baltic-Slavonic languages. (2) Velars with labialization. These velars appear in the Germanic languages partly with and partly without labialization; in the latter case they also fell together with prim. Germ. χ, k, ʒ which arose from Indg. k, g, gh. The most commonly accepted theory is that the Indg. labialized velars q, g, gh regularly became χ, k, ʒ in prim. Germ. before Indg. ū̌, ō, o (= Germ. a § 39), and χw, kw, ʒw before Indg. ē̌, ī̌, ǝ,<pb n="61"/>a, ā (= Germ. ō § 42); and that then the law became greatly obscured during the prim. Germ. period through form-transference and levelling out in various directions, as Goth. qam, OHG. quam, prim. form *ɡoma, I came, for Goth. OHG. *kam after the analogy of Goth. qima, OHG. quimu, original form *ɡemō, I come; Goth. ƕas, who? = Indg. *qos, for *has after the analogy of the gen. ƕis = Indg. *qeso, &amp;c.
    </p>

    <div type="note">
      <p>
        Note.—In several words the Indg. velars, when preceded or followed by a w or another labial in the same word, appear in the Germanic languages as labials by assimilation. The most important examples are:—Goth. wulfs, OE. OS. wulf, OHG. wolf, O.Icel. ulfr = Gr. λύκος for *ϝλύκος, prim. form *wĺqos, cp. Skr. vŕkas, wolf; Goth. fidwōr, OE. fēower (but fyϸer-fēte, four-footed), OS. OHG. fior, prim. form *qetwṓres, cp. Lithuanian keturì, Lat. quattuor, Gr. τέσσαρες, Skr. catvā́ras; Goth. fimf, OE. OS. fīf, OHG. fimf (finf) from *fimfi, prim. form *peŋqe, cp. Skr. páńca, Gr. πέντε, Lat. quīnque (for *pīnque), five; OHG. wulpa, she-wolf, from *wulƀī́, prim. form *wlqī́, cp. Skr. vrkī́; Goth. waírpan, OE. weorpan, OS. werpan, OHG. werfan, O.Icel. verpa, to throw, cp. O. Bulgarian vrῐgą, I throw; OE. swāpan, OHG. sweifan, to swing, cp. Lithuanian swaikstù, I become dizzy.

      § 135. Various theories have been propounded as to the chronological order in which the Indg. tenues, tenues aspiratae, mediae, and mediae aspiratae, were changed by the first sound-shifting in prim. Germanic. But not one of these theories is satisfactory. Only so much is certain that at the time when the Indg. mediae became tenues, the Indg. tenues must have been on the way to becoming voiceless spirants, otherwise the two sets of sounds would have fallen together.

        § 136. After the completion of the first sound-shifting, and while the principal accent was not yet confined to the<pb n="62"/>root-syllable, a uniform interchange took place between the voiceless and voiced spirants, which may be thus stated:—
      </p>

      <p>
        The medial or final spirants f, ϸ, χ, χw, s regularly became ƀ, đ, ʒ, ʒw, z when the vowel next preceding them did not, according to the original Indg. system of accentuation, bear the principal accent of the word.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ƀ, đ, ʒ, ʒw which thus arose from Indg. p, t, k, q underwent in the Germanic languages all further changes in common with the ƀ, đ, ʒ, ʒw from Indg. bh, dh, gh, ɡh.
      </p>

      <p>
        Verner’s law manifests itself most clearly in the various forms of strong verbs, where the infinitive, present participle, present tense, and preterite (properly perfect) singular had the principal accent on the root-syllable, but the indic. pret. plural, the pret. subj. (properly optative), and past participle had the principal accent on the ending, as prim. Germ. *wérϸō > OE. weorϸe, I become = Skr. vártā-mi, I turn, pret. 3 sing. *wárϸi > OE. wearϸ, he became = Skr. va-várta, has turned, pret. 1 pl. *wurđumí > OE. *wurđum (wurdon is the 3 pers. pl. used for all persons) = Skr. va-vrtimá; past part. *wurđaná- > OE. worden = Skr. va-vrtāná-; OS. birid = Skr. bhárati, he bears, Goth. 2 sing. Indic. Pass. baíraza = Skr. bhárasē. Goth. baírand, OHG. berant = Skr. bháranti, they bear; present participle Goth. baírands, O.Icel. berandi, OE. berende, OS. berandi, OHG. beranti, Gr. gen. φέροντος.

        <p>
          Note.—The prim. Germanic system of accentuation was like that of Sanskrit, Greek, &amp;c., i. e. the principal accent could fall on any syllable; it was not until a later period of the prim. Germanic language that the principal accent was confined to the root-syllable. See § 32.

      </p>

      <p>
        In Gothic the regular interchange between the voiceless and voiced spirants in the forms of strong verbs was, with two or three exceptions, given up by levelling out in favour of the voiceless spirants. In this respect the West-Germanic languages show an older stage than Gothic.

        Instead of ss (s) we often meet with st. In such cases the st is due to the analogy of forms where t was quite regular, e. g. regular forms were Goth. last, thou didst gather, inf. lisan; slōht, thou didst strike, inf. slahan; OE. meaht, OHG. maht, thou canst, inf. OHG. magan; then after the analogy of such forms were made 2 pers.<pb n="67"/>sing. Goth. wáist for *wáis, OE. wāst for *wās, OHG. weist for *weis; Goth. qast for *qass, inf. qiþan, to say; Goth. báust for *báus, inf. biudan, to bid; regular forms were pret. sing. Goth. waúrhta, OE. worhte, OHG. worhta, Goth. inf. waúrkjan, to work; then after the analogy of such forms were made OE. wiste, beside wisse, OHG. westa, beside wissa (wessa), I knew, inf. OE. witan; Goth. pret. sing. káupasta for *káupassa, inf. káupatjan, to strike with the palm of the hand, buffet.

        For purely practical purposes the above laws may be thus formulated:—every labial + t appears as ft, every guttural + t as ht, every dental + t as ss, s (st).

        § 140. Prim. Germanic Ҍn, đn, ʒn = Indg. pń-, tń-, kń-, qń- (by Verner’s law), and bhn-́, *dhn-́, ghn-́, ghn-́, became ҌҌ, đđ, ʒʒ before the principal accent, then later bb, dd, gg; and in like manner Indg. bn-́, dn-́, gn-́, gn-́ became bb, dd, gg. And these mediae were shifted to pp, tt, kk at the same time as the original Indg. mediae became tenues (§ 129). These geminated consonants were simplified to p, t, k after long syllables. Examples are: OE. hnæpp, OHG. napf, from *χnaҌn-́ or *χnabn-́, basin, bowl; OE. hoppian, O.Icel. hoppa, MHG. hopfen, from *χoҌn-́, to<pb n="68"/>hop; OE.

        § 143. χ became an aspirate (written h) initially before vowels, as Goth. OE. OS. hund, OHG. hunt, from *χunđan, prim. form *kmtóm, hundred; Goth. hunds, O.Icel. hundr, OE. OS. hund, OHG. hunt, from *xunđaz, dog, hound. Some scholars assume that it also became an aspirate medially between vowels.

In verbal forms the w was mostly re-introduced in the pret. pl. and pp. after the analogy of forms which regularly had w, e. g. Goth. swultum, swultans, for *sultum, *sultans, through the influence of forms like inf. swiltan, to die, pret. sing. swalt; similarly qumum, qumans, for *kumum, *kumans, inf. qiman, to come.
