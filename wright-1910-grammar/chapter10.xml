  <head>DECLENSION OF NOUNS</head>

    <p>
      § 176. Gothic nouns have two numbers—singular and plural; three genders—masculine, feminine, and neuter, as in the other Old Germanic languages, from which the gender of nouns in Gothic does not materially differ; four cases—Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, and Dative. The Vocative is mostly like the Nominative, but in the singular of some classes of nouns it regularly fell together with the Accusative, see §§ 87–8.
    </p>

    <div type="note">
      <p>
        Note.—It should be noted that what is called the dat. sing. in Gothic is originally the instrumental in the a-stems (§ 179) and masc. i-stems (§ 196); locative in the fem. i- (§ 198), u- (§ 202), and all consonant-stems (§§ 207–22); and the dat. only in the ō-stems (§ 190).

    <p>
      § 177. In Gothic, as in the oldest periods of the other Germanic languages, nouns are divided into two great classes, according as the stem originally ended in a vowel or consonant, cp. the similar division of nouns in Sanskrit, Latin and Greek. Nouns, whose stems originally ended in a vowel, belong to the vocalic or so-called Strong Declension. Those, whose stems end in -n, belong to the Weak Declension. All other consonantal stems are in this grammar put together under the general heading of ‘Minor Declensions’.
    </p>

    <p>
      The learner, who wishes to compare the Gothic case-endings with the corresponding forms of Latin, Greek, &amp;c.,<pb n="85"/>will find it useful to master Chapter V before attempting to do so, because what has already been stated there will not, as a rule, be repeated in the chapters on the Accidence.

          § 178. The a-declension comprises masculine and neuter nouns only, and corresponds to the Latin and Greek o-declension (Gr. masc. -ος, neut. -ον, Lat. -us, -um), for which reason it is sometimes called the o-declension. The a-declension is divided into pure a-stems, ja-stems, and wa-stems.

              The prim. Germanic forms of dags were: Sing. nom. *đaʒaz, acc. *đaʒan, voc. *đaʒ(e), gen. *đaʒesa (with pronominal ending, § 265), dat. *đaʒai, Indg. *dhoghōĩ (cp. Gr. θεῷ, to a god), instr. *đaʒē, -ō; Pl. nom. *đaʒōz, acc.<pb n="86"/>*đaʒanz, gen. *đaʒō̃n (cp. Gr. θεῶν, of gods), dat. *đaʒomiz. From what has been said in Chapter V on the vowels of unaccented syllables, it will be seen that all the forms of the sing. and plural, except the dat. sing. and gen. pl., are regularly developed from the corresponding prim. Germ. forms. daga is the old instrumental used for the dative. The -ē in dagē, which presupposes a prim. Germ. ending -ǣ̃n (§ 87, 1), has never been satisfactorily explained. The gen. in OE. O.Icel. daga, OS. dago, OHG. tago regularly goes back to *đaʒō̃n which would have become *dagō in Gothic, cp. gibō (§ 191).

            § 183. Apart from the -j- it is necessary in this class of nouns to distinguish between (1) nouns which have a short stem-syllable or a long open stem-syllable and (2) those which have a long closed stem-syllable or when the stem (apart from any prefix) is of more than one syllable. In the former case the gen. sing. regularly ends in -jis and in the latter in -eis, see §§ 153, 157. This distinction was preserved in the masculines, but in the neuters the original difference was almost entirely obliterated in favour of nouns belonging to (1). The old and the new forms exist side by side in a few words, as gen. andbahteis, gawaírpeis, beside andbahtjis, gawaírþjis. Cp. § 153 note.

All the forms of the sing. except the nom., and all forms of the pl. except the gen., are regularly developed from the corresponding prim. Germ. forms. *χarjaz became *haris (cp. § 155) and then the -j- in the cases where it was regular was extended to the nom. On harjē, see § 179.

In the nom. acc. voc. sing. the -ij- became ī after the loss of a, -(e), -an, then the ī (written ei) being protected by a consonant remained in the nom., but became shortened in the acc. and voc. (but see § 154). In the gen. sing. -ije- became -iji- and then the j disappeared between vowels; whence haírdeis. After the -ij- had become -j- in the dat. sing. and all forms of the pl. the further development of these case endings was the same as that of harjis (§ 157).

It is divided into pure ō-stems, jō-stems, and wō-stems. The wō-stems and also the jō-stems with a short radical syllable are declined exactly like the pure ō-stems. The remaining jō-stems are also declined like the pure ō-stems, except that the nom. sing. ends in -i.

In the parent language the masc. and fem. i-stems were declined alike. In Gothic the nom. acc. voc. sing. regularly fell together with the a-declension (§ 179), which was the reason why the gen. and dat. sing. and probably also the gen. pl. of the masc. nouns were re-formed after the analogy of the a-declension.

      <p>
        § 206. In the parent language the nom. sing. ended partly in -ēn, -ōn, and partly in -ē̃, - ō̃. The reason for this difference is unknown. The various Indg. languages generalized one or other of the two forms in prehistoric times, as in Gr. nom. ποιμήν, shepherd; ἡγεμών, leader; acc. ποιμένα, ἡγεμόνα, beside nom. Skr. rā́jā, king; Lat. homo, man; sermo, discourse; acc. rā́jānam, hominem, sermōnem. In prim. Germanic the two forms existed side by side, as in Goth. hana from -ēn, -ōn (§ 87, (1)), beside tuggō, haírtō from -ō̃ (§ 89). In Goth. the -ō̃ became<pb n="96"/>restricted to the feminine and neuter, whereas in the West Germanic languages it became restricted to the masculine, as OE. guma, OS. gumo, OHG. gomo, man, from -ō̃, beside OE. tunge, OS. tunga, OHG. zunga, tongue; OE. ēage, OS. ōga, OHG. ouga, eye, from -ōn.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the inflected forms the stem-endings had originally the following phases of ablaut: acc. sing. and nom. pl. -on-, loc. sing. -en-, gen. dat. sing. and acc. gen. pl. consonantal -n-, dat. and loc. pl. vocalic -n-. These distinctions were not faithfully preserved in the historic period of any of the Indg. languages. Owing to levelling out in various directions the different stem-endings were extended to cases to which they did not originally belong. Thus in Gothic the -an- in the nom. pl. hanans from prim. Germ. *xananiz was extended to the gen. The old form is still found in ab-n-ē, of fathers; aúhs-n-ē, of oxen; man-n-ē, of men. In tuggō the ō of the nom. sing. was extended to the other cases. And similarly in OE. the -an- of the acc. sing. of guma, man; tunge, tongue, was extended to the gen. and dat., so that all three cases became the same: guman, tungan.
      </p>

        The masc. and fem. n-stems were originally declined alike, as in Latin, Greek and Sanskrit, but already in the prehistoric period of the Germanic languages they became differentiated in some of the cases by partly generalizing one or other of the forms. Thus, as we have seen above, the nom. sing. originally ended in -ō̃ or -ōn in both genders, Gothic restricted -ō̃ to the feminine and -ōn to the masculine, but in the West Germanic languages the reverse took place. In the feminine Gothic O.Icel. OS. and OHG. levelled out the original long vowel of the nom. sing. into the oblique cases, whereas OE. had the same forms as the masculine except in the nom. sing. tunge from prim. Germanic -ōn.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a morphological point of view the n-stems should<pb n="97"/>be divided into -an, -jan, and -wan stems, but in Gothic as in the other Germanic languages all three classes were declined alike.

          The prim. Germanic forms of hana were: Sing. nom. *χanēn or -ōn (cp. Gr. ποιμήν, shepherd; ἡγεμών, leader), acc. *χananun (cp. Gr. ἡγεμόνα), gen. *χanenaz or *χaniniz (cp. Gr. ποιμένος), dat. (originally loc.) *χanini (cp. Gr. ποιμένι); Pl. nom. *xananiz (cp. Gr. ἡγεμόνες), acc. *χananunz older *χannunz (cp. Gr. ἡγεμόνας, κύνας = Indg. *kun-ns (§§ 53–4), dogs), gen. *χannō̃n (cp. Goth. aúhsn-ē, OE. oxn-a, of oxen, Gr. κυν-ῶν, of dogs), dat. *χanunmiz. The Gothic cases of the sing. and the nom. pl. are regularly developed from the corresponding prim. Germanic forms. The acc. pl. hanans is the nom. used for the accusative. *xannō̃n would have become *hannō; hananē had the second -an- from the nom. pl., and the -ē is of the same unknown origin as in dagē (§ 179). The dat. pl. was formed direct from han- + am, the ending of the a-stems.

          The fem. n-stems were originally declined like the masculine. As has been pointed out in § 206 the -ō of the nom. tuggō was levelled out into the oblique cases just as in Lat. sermo, discourse, acc. sermōnem, gen. sermōnis, dat. sermōnī, abl. sermōne; Pl. nom. acc. sermōnēs, gen. sermōnum, dat. abl. sermōnibus. The -ō in the gen. pl. regularly goes back to prim. Germanic -ō̃n (§ 87, (1)). The dat. pl. was formed direct from tugg- + ōm, the ending of the ō-stems (§ 191).
        </p>

        <p>
          The īn-stems had -īn- in all forms of the sing. and pl. already in prim. Germanic, as Sing. nom. *manaʒīn, acc. *manaʒīnun; gen. *manaʒīnaz, or -iz, dat. *manaʒīni; Pl. nom. *manaʒīniz, acc. *manaʒīnunz, gen. *manaʒīnō̃n, dat. *manaʒīnmiz, from which the Gothic forms, except the nom. sing. and acc. dat. plural, were regularly developed. The regular nom. sing. would be *managi (§ 87, (1)). managei was a new formation with -ei from the oblique cases. The acc. pl. manageins is the nom. used for the accusative (cp. § 207). The dat. pl. manageim was a new formation similar to hanam, tuggōm. On the origin of this declension, see Brugmann’s Grundriss, vol. II (second ed.), pp. 312–18.

The nom. sing. is the acc. or voc. used for the nominative. The ending -ōr, -ēr would not have become -ar in Gothic, see § 89 note.
